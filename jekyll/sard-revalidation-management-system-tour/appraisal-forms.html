		  <h1>Appraisal Forms</h1>
		             
			<p>Our Appraisal forms are all fully integrated into the system and reflect the appraisal forms provided by the GMC, so they will follow the standards required as well as being recognisable. To ensure that the system is easy to understand and simple to use our appraisal forms are linked directly to the individuals portfolio and as such we are able to pull through any relevant information without having to duplicate entry or effort.</p>

		  <p>Once again the appraisal forms follow the simple red, amber and green status to allow the user to quickly identify which sections are complete and which still need some further work. We have created this part of the system to ensure that the appraisal forms work for both the doctor and the appraiser seamlessly combining all the information that both parties need to ensure that the important reflective discussion can take place, which is after all the most important part of the process.</p>

			<p>As mentioned above, the appraisal forms will pull any relevant information found in the portfolio to ensure that doctors do not have to duplicate any work they have already uploaded previously. Areas such as Continuing Professional Development, Complaints and SUI's will all automatically be populated in the correct sections of the form.</p>

			<p>Once all sections of the appraisal form are completed then submission for recommendation by the Responsible Officer can be undertaken.</p>
