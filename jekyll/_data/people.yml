    <p>Throughout my working career, both in the NHS and outside of it,
     it has always been a passion of mine to make things better, to be
     part of something that has a positive impact. The premise is always
     the same, invest time in improving the things we have to do, make
     the small things easy to eventually make the big things easy, and
     working for SARD is the epitome of this.</p>

    <p>I have always felt that it is important to understand why we do
    things, asking the important questions and get to the real nub of
    the questions in order to produce the best answers. If my skills and
    knowledge, combined with those around me can help have a positive
    impact on the organisations we are working with then I have started
    to achieve my goals.</p>

    <p>I have worked in both the private and the public sector over the
    last 16 years, and prior to working with SARD I spent 5 years in
    the NHS, creating positive change and living the day to day,
    challenges as well as witnessing the challenges that others faced.
    My last role was Head of Learning and Development at Oxleas NHS
    Foundation Trust, a very different role to the one I am in now.</p>

    <p>As like many of my colleagues, I like to indulge in activities
    outside of work, and I am currently finishing off a number of writing
    projects, which I find both relaxing and rewarding. Who knows one
    day you may get to read some of my work when they are on the
    bestsellers list.

    <p>Hello! I'm Sophie and I am one of the account managers at
    SARD.  In fact, I was the very first account manager SARD ever had.
    When I joined the company in November 2012, SARD
    was on the verge of growth and it was very exciting. I was
    there when the first big contracts came in, when it became
    clear that SARD was not just a small player in a big field,
    but could actually make a difference.</p>

    <p>For me the way SARD is different than anywhere I've
    ever worked before is that our customer service is not just
    a meaningless slogan. No one in this company reads from
    scripts or waves away queries. We are all invested in our
    solutions and we're all invested in making sure that our
    clients and end users like our systems as much as we do.</p>

    <p>Before I came to SARD I completed an MSc in Science
    Communication, which is an interest I still hold dear. Which
    is why Kevin and I run a monthly science and technology meet-up
    in Crystal Palace, called the Silicon Triangle, where we get
    together with like minded people and talk about the projects
    we are working on. Listening to the enthusiasm of others is
    always inspiring and often helps us innovate our solutions as well.</p>

    <p>Besides this I write science stories on sciphie.wordpress.com
    and am the sub-editor of the zine ‘You've Got Mail'
    (http://gotmailzine.wordpress.com/)</p>

    <p>Customer service is a great passion of mine. Throughout my working life, I've          always strived to make certain that my organisation provides the best service to         clients. For me, this means friendly, approachable and knowledgeable staff who           consistently seek feedback to meet customer needs. I believe that everyone at SARD       shares these values.</p>

    <p>My background is in retail banking, managing relationships for both private and        corporate customers. I hope that I can use my skills to ensure SARD's products are       providing the best results for our customers.</p>

    <p>Outside of work,  you'll find me playing cricket somewhere in the Kent                 countryside, following my beloved Arsenal FC, or supporting my children in their         footballing and cheerleading endeavors. I'm also a history graduate with a keen          interest in modern history and revisionism.</p>

    <p>I'm Naomi and I'm the Operations Manager at SARD.</p>

    <p>As well as keeping an eye on the accounts, I also look after
      HR and office management here at our base in Crystal
      Palace. Unlike so many companies, there's a real culture of
      ‘pitching in' here, and in addition to my regular tasks
      I know my way around the revalidation system and often jump in
      to help on the Live Chats or answer the phone to a medic in need
      of technical advice. No two days are the same, and that's part of
      what makes this such a dynamic and innovative company to work for.</p>

    <p>I studied Drama at university before working in theatre facilities
    management and then spent several years running the head office of a
    cocktail bar chain before landing at SARD. Industries may differ, but
    the core values of customer service and integrity of product are what
    I look for in a workplace and SARD has these in abundance.</p>

    <p>Like many of the team here, I have a creative side and I exercise this
    in my local theatre company and in front of my trusty sewing machine.</p>

    <p>I am an account manager for SARD JV which gives me hands on
    experience with people using the system every day, whether this
    is improving and streamlining our system to the specific needs
    of a client or problem solving on our online chat feature.</p>
    <p>As we are a relatively small company it means that we all
    feel a very personal stake in the companies activities, whether
    that is dealing with clients, testing systems or organizing
    charity events.</p>

    <p>Because we are very open as a company it means as employees
    we can each tailor our work according to our own strengths
    and what we most enjoy.</p>

    <p>Having studied at both Sussex University and University of
    East London, I spent 6 years working in the world of Optics
    in various different ways. This has instilled an interest in
    the ways different institutions and industries can collaborate
    and find mutual goals.</p>

    <p>I feel we are in an interesting position being a joint venture
    with an NHS trust, we are both part of the NHS framework but have
    the freedom to really get to the core of problems and provide
    innovative and fresh solutions.</p>

    <p>In my time away from work I run a storytelling night in
    Crystal Palace, I have been involved in writing and performing
    for many years, including participating in the Edinburgh and
    Brighton Fringes Festivals.</p>

    <p>Hi, I&#39;m Barbara and I&#39;m a senior developer at SARD.</p>

    <p>I have been working in software engineering for over 15 years
    and I hope that my experience brings a lot of value to what we are
    doing. Our small team is great to work with and you can see that
    everyone here really cares about the products that we build.</p>

    <p>I have been here right from the start, joining after a short
    career break to have children. I have helped to build the system
    from the bottom up. I think it&#39;s essential to have a solid understanding
    of the whole code and it means that together with the rest of the team
    I can quickly appraise and react to new client requirements. In fact,
    in my opinion, that responsiveness is what sets us apart from
    our competitors.</p>

    <p>I typically work from home on the Isle of Wight, which is a beautiful
    place to live, especially if you enjoy the great outdoors. If I&#39;m not
    coding or managing the family then you will probably find me out running
    along the local beach.</p>

    <p>I love working at SARD - it allows me to develop my skills in a
    great environment where we all work to make people’s jobs a bit easier.
    Part of what I value as a developer is the ability to talk to the people
    who use what I build, and this is something that SARD is very good at.
    The customer service ethic here is the best I’ve ever been involved with,
    and it is very exciting to be able to receive a request and build a solution
    in a very short time-frame.</p>
    <p>For my background, I studied Modern History at University and then moved
    into IT, building reporting systems and working in software project management.
    I have spent time living and working in South Africa and Scotland. In my spare
    time I enjoy running, yoga and vegetarian cooking, as well as learning to be a
    better developer!</p>

    <p>I make a living from working with startup and early-stage businesses, so I
    have to choose who I work with very carefully. I chose to engage with SARD JV
    because I saw in its founder, Kevin Monk, a genuine passion and commitment to
    build a sustainable business for the long-term, and in its co-founder, Oxleas
    NHS Foundation Trust, then his client, a willingness to think outside the box
    in how to achieve their goals. We negotiated a joint-venture agreement, and
    have moved through the tricky start-up phase into a fully self-sustaining and
    rewarding business for all involved, in which the personal qualities which
    first attracted me are now firmly rooted in the culture of the company: SARD JV
    is caring, forward-looking, responsive and adaptive.</p>

    <p>With 30 years experience, spread equally over public and private sectors,
    I'm the gray-hair in the team, and help balance the perspectives of the
    stakeholders, maximise alignment of interests and avoid the common pitfalls in
    a growth-oriented business. Starting out as an academic theoretical chemist,
    my earlier career has moved through: systems programming, software development,
    intelligence and security services interests in technology, technology research
    & development programmes, government contracting, the introduction of digital
    television, digital convergence and regulation, and business development,
    finance, venture capital investment, turnaround and exit (M&amp;A/Flotation).</p>

    <p>I founded Haven Ventures in the UK in 2002, and we now operate the same model
    of collaborative business development, investment and turnaround services in
    the UK and six countries in Latin America and more recently Africa.</p>

    <p> Five years ago I led the development of the Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust Strengthened Appraisal and Revalidation Database or SARD as it is familiarly known.  Since SARD JV became a commercial business I have played an integral role in the continued development of the system.</p>

    <p> I qualified as a Medical Doctor in 1985, completing my training on the Guy’s and St Thomas’ regional psychiatric rotation and obtained my Membership of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (MRCPsych) diploma in 1992. I completed my doctorate (Ph.D) and post doctorate research at King’s College Hospital & Institute of Psychiatry and obtained my Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D) degree in 1996 and in the same year was appointed consultant psychiatrist/senior lecturer at Greenwich District Hospital and Guy’s & St Thomas’ London.

    <p>I was elected Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (FRCPsych) in 2007 for my contributions to the field of Psychiatry through clinical practice, teaching, education and research. In 2014, I was elected an international Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association.</p>

    <p>I have received commendations and won national awards for innovative and high quality care delivered within my multidisciplinary clinical team and these include National Association of Psychiatric Intensive Care Units team of the year award; Care Services Improvement Partnership ‘Positive Practice’ award; commendation by Hospital Doctors Award committee; and award of the British Association for Medical Managers.</p>

    <p>Four years ago I was an integral part of the team that designed and developed the Oxleas revalidation system - SARD - in conjunction with Mango Swiss Ltd, this product is now available commercially through SARD JV. I was involved in the initial concepts of revalidation long before they became a national process and utilised my intimate knowledge in this area to shape the process behind the system as well as the flexibility required for both Oxleas and other health care organisations.</p>
