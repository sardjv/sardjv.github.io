We do this by undertaking meaningful work, with real integrity and only engage in developing solutions that we truly believe in.

                    <p>At SARD JV we know our most important assets are the people we work with. It is not just about having highly skilled and gifted team members (which we are happy to say we have), but more about surrounding ourselves with individuals who share our attitudes and values and want to achieve the same high standards and goals. Our people are the foundation of our business.</p>

						  <h2>Philip Bottle</h2>
						  <h3>Director of Sales and Marketing</h3>	  
						  <p>Throughout my working career, both in the NHS and outside of it, it has always been a passion of mine to make things better, whether that is in a small way, or to be part of something that has a large scale positive impact. The premise is always the same, invest time in improving the things we have to do, make the small things easy to eventually make the big things easy, and working for SARD is the epitome of this. 
 
I have always felt that it is important to understand why we do things, asking the important questions and get to the real nub of the questions in order to produce the best answers.
 
I have worked in both the private and the public sector over the last 16 years, and prior to working with SARD JV I spent 5 years in the NHS, creating positive change and living the day to day, challenges as well as witnessing the challenges that others faced. So for me it is important to help make things better and this is something I am incredibly passionate about. If my skills and knowledge, combined with those around me can help have a positive impact then I have started to achieve my goals.

						  <h2>Nicholas Cooke</h2>
						  <h3>Account Manager</h3>
						  <p>I am an account manager for SARD JV which gives me hands on experience with people using the system every day, whether this is improving and streamlining our system to the specific needs of a client or problem solving on our online chat feature.
As we are a relatively small company it means that we all feel a very personal stake in the companies activities, whether that is dealing with clients, testing systems or organizing charity events.
 
Because we are very open as a company it means as employees we can each tailor our work according to our own strengths and what we most enjoy.
 
Having studied at both Sussex University and University of East London, I spent 6 years working in the world of Optics in various different ways. This has instilled an interest in the ways different institutions and industries can collaborate and find mutual goals.
I feel we are in an interesting position being a joint venture with an NHS trust, we are both part of the NHS framework but have the freedom to really get to the core of problems and provide innovative and fresh solutions.

						  <h2>Sophie Buijsen</h2>
						  <h3>Account Manager</h3>
						  <p>Hello! 
I’m Sophie and I am one of the account managers at SARD JV.  In fact, I was the very first account manager SARD JV ever had. When I joined the company in November 2012, SARD was on the verge of growth and it was very exciting. I was there when the first big contacts came in, when it became clear that SARD JV was not just a small player in a big field, but could actually make a difference.

For me the way SARD JV is different than anywhere I’ve ever worked before is that our customer service is not just a meaningless slogan. No one in this company reads from scripts or waves away queries. We are all invested in our solutions and we’re all invested in making sure that our clients and end users like our systems as much as we do.
 
Before I came to SARD JV I completed an MSc in Science Communication, which is an interest I still hold dear. Which is why Kevin and I run a monthly science and technology meet-up in Crystal Palace, called the Silicon Triangle, where we get together with like minded people and talk about the projects we are working on. Listening to the enthusiasm of others is always inspiring and often helps us innovate our solutions as well.
Besides this I write science stories on sciphie.wordpress.com and am the sub-editor of the zine ‘You’ve Got Mail’ (http://gotmailzine.wordpress.com/) </p>

					<h3>Testimonials</h3>
					<p>“Following a smooth and successful implementation of SARD JV at King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, the team at SARD JV did not stop listening to us. They still pay attention to our  comments and suggestions in order to have  a system that keeps meeting our requirements. The feedback from our medical and dental staff is great. The reporting feature on SARD JV is excellent and  it  has made my job a lot easier.
Keep up the good work!”</p><h5>- Ludovic Dogbe, Job Planning & Revalidation Manager at King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust</h5>


					<p>“As the administrator of the medical appraisal and revalidation processes in an acute Trust, I was looking for an efficient and straightforward online system to support both my functions and my doctors. SARD provides this in a way which concentrates on the essentials of the processes, with a support team constantly looking to build on the already excellent system, including incorporating improvements suggested by clients. My doctors and I also really value the real time online and telephone support. I commend SARD to any organisation looking for a first class and flexible system”.</p><h5>- Andrew Forsyth, Revalidation Project Manager
Harrogate and District NHS Foundation Trust</h5>


					<p>"As an experienced appraiser using the original GMC approved documentation I had reservations about utilising the SARD software. These reservations were rapidly dispelled following the conduct of my first appraisal with the SARD documentation. It is really helpful that the web based access makes it so accessible whenever necessary and convenient. Since its adoption by my Trust the SARD team have responded positively to suggestions for improvements in its implementation. Significantly,  every single appraisee and my consultant colleagues have been very enthusiastic about using SARD. SARD has made the Revalidation process far more straightforward with its intuitive and disciplined approach".</p><h5>- Dr Tony Nicholl, Trust appraiser.  Consultant Anaesthetist Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust</h5>


					<p>“My involvement with SARD is on a daily basis, I find the system is easily understood and effortlessly taught even to the most sceptical!  I receive more and more positive feedback from the doctors now using the system and as they enter year 2 its pleasing to hear how easy they are finding the system and indeed to whole process of appraisal. I cannot praise the staff at SARDjv enough, they are always very helpful and knowledgeable.  Most importantly to me they are always very open and show willingness to develop the system and accommodate suggestions of change to the system".</p><h5>- Jane Clarke, Appraisal & Revalidation Manager Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust </h5>
					
					
			<p>“We have been managing our medical appraisal and revalidation process through SARD JV since July 2013.  The system is easy to use, can be easily adapted and we’ve had some really positive feedback from our doctors using it.  The team at SARD JV are very helpful, responsive and dedicated to providing a system fit for purpose.  I would happily recommend SARD JV to any Trust looking for an e-system to manage its appraisal and revalidation process”.</p><h5>- Angela Salmen, Senior Medical Staffing Manager Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust </h5>
