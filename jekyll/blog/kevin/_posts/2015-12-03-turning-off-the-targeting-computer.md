excerpt: When Apollo 11 took the first men to the moon, it was intended that the Lunar Module would land autonomously; guided entirely by computer. However, in the last 500ft, Neil Armstrong turned off the ‘targeting computer’. Although the site selection team had picked a smooth patch of ground, the state of the guidance art at the time was taking the LM into a field of boulders the size of a football field.

When Apollo 11 took the first men to the moon, it was intended that the Lunar Module would land autonomously; guided entirely by computer. However, in the last 500ft, Neil Armstrong turned off the ‘targeting computer’. Although the site selection team had picked a smooth patch of ground, the state of the guidance art at the time was taking the LM into a field of boulders the size of a football field. Neil Armstrong took manual control, safely landed and the rest is history. All subsequent Apollo landings switched off the targeting computer at final descent.

Were the computer systems redundant? No. Quite the contrary. They successfully navigated the majority of the 384’400 km journey. But in that last 500ft, context matters and that’s when  you want the best Bayesian decision computers we have; the human brain! No amount of preparation or intellect by a software engineer 2 years prior will account for being there, at the time, making very human decisions based upon context.

On account of this, it’s a guiding principle of our software that human override is a MUST have feature. We have an instinctive reluctance for mandatory fields and our online chat system ensures there’s a RealHuman Brain v1.0 TM assisting our users through the process. Because, at the coal face, as sure as eggs is eggs, when it comes to a dispute between our context-aware users and the algorithm that thinks it knows better, we’re going to bet on the human EVERY TIME.
