      <h1>Is SARD for me?</h1>

<h2 style="color:#00B2B2">Vision, Culture & Values</h2>

  <p>At SARD we know our most important assets are the people we work with. It is not just about having highly skilled and gifted team members (which we are happy to say we have), but more about surrounding ourselves with individuals who share our attitudes and values and want to achieve the same high standards and goals. Our people are the foundation of our business.</p>

  <p>Our company culture is open, relaxed, friendly, sociable, flexible, non-hierarchical, where you can work with a high level of autonomy and have the space to express yourself and speak your mind.</p>

  <p>As a company we also support Dan Pink’s view of employee motivation and the link with <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation">Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose.</a></p>


  <h4 style="color:#00B2B2">Autonomy</h4>

  Your urge to control your own life. To this end you will be given the scope to manage your own workload without having someone looking over your shoulder. However, should you require support from your fellow team members, you can rest assured that it will be at hand.</p>

  <h4 style="color:#00B2B2">Mastery</h4>

  Your desire to get better and better at something that matters. To this end we are passionate about continuous development and support employees with role related training as identified through regular appraisals. You can be sure we are as passionate about your development as you are and will provide the necessary support.</p>

  <h4 style="color:#00B2B2">Purpose</h4>

  Your yearning to do what you do in the service of something larger than yourself. To this end we are clear and passionate about the role we play in supporting the healthcare sector to ensure that the quality standards of medical staff and staff related workflow is delivered efficiently and effectively. We hope that you will share this sense of purpose too.</p>

  <h2 style="color:#00B2B2">Additional Benefits</h2>
<p>As a company providing appraisal software, we have a strong belief in the value of regular appraisal and offer all members of our team six monthly opportunities to reflect upon progress and the future direction of their careers with us. Pay is reviewed annually.</p>

<p>We hold quarterly team 'Away Days' for the whole company to meet, put forward items for discussion and contribute to future strategic direction. 
We also organise regular less formal opportunities to socialise which have included regular team lunches, escape rooms, cocktail making and mini-golf.</p>

<p>In 2018 Crisis UK has been selected via staff vote as our first charity to support through SARD fundraising activities. All members of our team are invited to participate in this by whatever means they are most interested be it running, jumping, baking or quizzing. </p>
