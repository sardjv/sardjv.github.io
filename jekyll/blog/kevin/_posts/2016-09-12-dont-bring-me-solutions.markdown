Nearly all procurement requirements are defined by a presupposed solution. Consequently, very few succeed in solving the root problem as effectively and cheaply as possible. This is easily resolved by making the core problems the backbone of a requirement document.

I've seen many hundreds of requirement documents over the course of my engineering career. I can think of perhaps a handful of occassions where the commissioner outlined *the actual problem*. More often it would be a long specification list coupled with MoSCoW: **M**ust have, **S**hould have, **C**ould have, **W**ould have. Grab the nearest requirement document you have to hand and ask yourself this - does this state a problem that must be solved or a perceived solution? I'm going to be picky here too. A problem is not "It needs to output data for x, y and z in Excel" or "There must be 24/7 telephone support." because getting data into Excel or having telephone support is not your problem. Problems look more fuzzy like "We struggle to make decisions based on x,y and z." or "users become dispondent and fail to engage unless they feel supported."

I can see that defining a requirement like this is hard to audit. "Does the supplier provide 24/7 telephone support?" is an easy and non ambiguous question. "Are our users engaged and confident in using the system?" is much harder but I think we should try because the results are worth it.

Conflating solutions and problems diminishes the clients role as the domain expert. They know the problem. The supplier can try to infer the problem from the list of required solutions but they're inevitably going to misread it and they're less likely to propose something better. It also diminishes the supplier's role as the solution expert. They know the solutions at their disposal. For example, Henry Ford's customers didn't need "a faster horse". He correctly guessed their problem and had a proposed solution - a hemp oil engine on wheels!

And maybe a hemp oil engine suprised you? It suprised me. It suprised me because I already had a picture of what the solution to the faster horse problem was. I imagined he created a petrol or diesel engine but he didn't. The first Model T Ford was constructed from hemp and ran on hemp oil. When we have a very clear picture of what we *think* a solution is, it can be difficult to articulate our root problem. Those dumbies asking for a "faster horse"! Sheesh! They should have asked for a petrol engine... No! They should have articulated their problem... "My horse gets sick", "It takes me too long to travel." because by doing so it frees up the whole world to solve the problem rather than seek out the narrow group of facilitators for a presupposed solution.
