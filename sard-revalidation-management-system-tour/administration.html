		  <h1>Administration</h1>
		  <h4>A frequently asked question...</h4>

			<p>"The administration area looks complicated and there are many areas to configure, is it going to take me a long time to configure? And am I going to need a lot of administration support to keep our revalidation system running?"</p>

			<p>NO. Definitely not.</p>

			<p>It's a mantra of the SARD product...</p>

			<p>Convention over Configuration</p>

			<p>SARD is delivered preconfigured.</p>

			<p>It's a common problem; you want a system that is flexible but you also want the implementation to be as painless as possible; we have found a solution. SARD assumes some conventions and we give you the power to tweak those settings to your organisation. Other than some initial importation of your doctors and your organisational structure, your doctors are free to use the system from day one.</p>

			<h4>Administration Introduction</h4>

			<p>SARD is highly configurable without the requirement to change the back end structure of the system. This means that you can change the system to meet your organisation's needs, whatever they may be. Regardless of the specialities you have, or the appraisal datasets you require for your doctors, SARD can match this with minimum input or disruption. SARD was designed to support your organisations processes as opposed to your organisation having to try and make the system work for them. The flexibility of the system also enables SARD to change with the over arching revalidation process, when and if things change in the future with minimal disruption to the organisations use of the system.</p>

			<p>With SARD administration you can create new roles, new datasets, add and remove users, upload relevant information and run reports at the simple click of a mouse. The administration is so simple it requires minimal training and input before use. The beauty of the system is an organisation can make SARD as simple or as complex as required to meet its specific challenges, without having to compromise on the functionality of the system itself. As SARD takes care of the technical stuff behind the scenes there should be no need to have teams of people running around trying to pull the information together, this is mainly due to the user being in control of their section of the system. In fact other than one or two administrators no one else using SARD should ever have to see the admin section let alone use it.</p>

		  <h4>Tailoring Revalidation to Doctors and their Medical Roles</h4>

			<p>One of the great features of SARD is the ability to tailor the GMP portfolio of supporting evidence to the specific medical roles of your doctors; even tailored to a single doctor if required. This is beneficial for a number of reasons:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>The supporting evidence being requested is relevant.</li>
				<li>The doctor needn't waste time interpreting the GMP Portfolio.</li>
				<li>The portfolio is flexible to even the most uncommon medical roles.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>To the left is a screen grab of the Medical Roles on our demonstration website. Click on the image to see an enlarged version. The list of medical roles includes common generic roles such as:<p>

			<ul>
				<li>Inpatient Doctor</li>
				<li>Outpatient Doctor</li>
				<li>SASG</li>
				<li>Psychiatrist</li>
				<li>Surgeon</li>
				<li>Anaesthetist</li>
				<li>etc...</li>
			</ul>

			<p>These roles are prepopulated and preconfigured with the guidelines outlined for each Royal College. SARD provides the template for all the common medical roles and then you can decide if they require modification but you have a template from which to work from.</p>

			<p>You may wish to add roles that more closely match your specific needs. As an example, you may have a group of doctors participating in academic research and therefore Publications and Research Papers should form part of their portfolio of supporting evidence. We've already provided a template for you to modify for your organisation. Another role may be those doctors who oversee the implementation of Revalidation and therefore completion of the ORSA and your revalidation implementation plan may form part of your assessment.</p>

			<h4>Assign Appraisal Datasets to Medical Roles</h4>

			<p>Once you are content that the medical roles match those within your organisation, you can assign the appraisal datasets that are relevant to that role.</p>

			<p>INFORMATION SECTION ***Terminology: Appraisal Datasets - Appraisal Datasets are a term we use for specified pieces of evidence that an organisation may required that are linked to the domain attributes of one of more domains.***</p>

			<p>The Appraisal Dataset Matrix allows an administrator to configure which pieces of supporting evidence are deemed suitable for each doctor. The assigning of appraisal datasets to medical roles is a simple mouse click to add a tick in the relevant box.</p>

			<p>The mapping in the image on the left is only for demonstration purposes but hopefully demonstrates the general principle.</p>

			<h4>Data Importation</h4>

			<p>When you first receive SARD and at various intervals over the years, you will need to feed the SARD system some basic information about your organisation and data from other systems. Clearly the most important of these - and the bare minimum that needs to be conducted upon receipt - is to tell SARD who your system users are. This is a simple process of uploading a CSV file (Comma Separated Variable) file that includes basic information such as their names, where they work, an email address and a unique reference number such as their employee ID. Once this has been uploaded then the system is ready to use and you can begin to send email invitations to your doctors. You can also upload the following data:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>New staff starter lists</li>
				<li>Staff leaver lists</li>
				<li>Legacy appraisal data</li>
				<li>Legacy Multisource Feedback data</li>
				<li>GMC memberships</li>
				<li>Section 12 Data</li>
				<li>Approved Clinician Data</li>
			</ul>

			<p>INFORMATION SECTION ***Terminology: CSV File - This is essentially a Microsoft Excel file that can be produced from almost any system such as The NHS Electronic Staff Records (ESR) system. We can provide templates for exporting ESR data but we'll be happy to help your administrator get this first step right and is included in the purchase price.***</p>


			<h4>Organisational Structure</h4>

			<p>To allow reporting at a directorate, hospital, site or even ward level, SARD can be configured to match the structure of your organisation. For NHS organisations this maps to the structures typically found in ESR as a starting point. Based upon the user data imported, the responsible officer, appraiser, lead doctors and clinical directors can overview the state of revalidation and appraisal within their organisation. As an example we present a typical structure of ESR data that you may find within an NHS Trust but it may be that your organisation more naturally maps to a number of hospitals or clinics in which case they can be configured to match that structure. Shown here is the configuration menu for ESR that includes:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Directorate</li>
				<li>Position Title</li>
				<li>ESR Roles</li>
				<li>Site Names</li>
				<li>Location</li>
				<li>Team</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>GMC Membership Management</h4>

			<p>General Medical Council membership can be managed from the administration section. The reporting page provides a list of all those doctors whom a GMC membership is missing. There is also pre-emptive support for General Dental Council membership in readiness for the possibility of GDC revalidation.</p>


			<h4>Centrally Administered Evidence Upload</h4>

			<p>In some scenarios it may be more practical if specific pieces of evidence are to be uploaded centrally by an administrator or team charged with responsibility for that type of data. An example would be complaint data from a complaints team, serious untoward incidents from an SUI team or Section 12 / Approved Clinician data. The potential for administrators to upload evidence against a doctor's portfolio is limitless as an administrator can assign e-documents and evidence against any of the doctors portfolio requirements.</p>

			<h4>GMC Revalidation Recommendations</h4>

			<p>An overview of revalidation within your organisation can be viewed and managed from within the administration section. A pie chart gives a quick overview of who has been revalidated, who is approaching renewal and warns of any revalidations that are outside of the revalidation period.</p>

			<p>Administrators with appropriate access rights can also maintain the revalidation data on behalf of the responsible officer.</p>

			<h4>Appraisal Management</h4>

			<p>Appraisal compliance across the trust is available to all administrators with the relevant permission. This allows an administrator assisting a Responsible Officer to see the compliance across the trust and manage appraisal tracking for new starters and those who may have completed their last appraisal on a different system.</p>

			<p>Doctors can be marked exempt from appraisal compliance, for instance if they are new starters or on long term leave. This means your compliance rates only include those who will be appraised this year.</p>

			<h4>User Management</h4>

			<p>User management allows an administrator to see all the users on the system and edit their details. There is a search facility for quickly finding doctors within your trust and an advanced user search that allows you to e-mail doctors within a very specific group (e.g. 'doctors whose appraisal is due within the next 2 months and have not started an appraisal yet'). This is also the place to change relationships between doctors such as reassigning the appraiser for a doctor or selecting the clinical director for a directorate.</p>

      <p>The invitation system can be operated form here and the doctor will receive an email invitation that invites them on to the site and prompts them to set a password etc.</p>
