Beyond the technical and support aspects, we have found the SARD JV team to be very easy to work with. They are dedicated to providing us with good service and are proactive in meeting our needs. At every phase, from contract negotiations to information governance, they have provided the highest standard of service.

SARD JV is an organisation that we are delighted to be working with and they have a system we would happily recommend to any other NHS Trusts or designated bodies based on our experience to date.
