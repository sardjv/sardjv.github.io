This week we welcomed a new member to the SARD team! David will be in our offices full-time to answer queries that come in through our chat system. 

From David:
"Hello there, I’m David and i’ve just started my role as Customer Support Assistant. I’ll be on the Live Chat Support to help our clients if the have any questions or problems with our system.

Before joining SARD JV i worked as a sales assistant for 6 years. I feel customer service is a priority and, enjoy solving problems and helping people. I get a great deal of satisfaction when i’ve managed to help someone out so enjoy my work very much.  

I studied Theatre at Brit School of Performing Art and enjoy all aspects of the theatre. I’m a member of a local theatre and, in my spare time enjoy reading and building lego."

We're very pleased to have David on board and will be working with him over the next few weeks to make sure he is ready to answer all your queries.
So next time you see David's photo pop up on the Live Chat system, feel free to introduce yourself and say hello!
