The work is varied and flexible, and there will be plenty of opportunity for creativity in your workload.</p>

<p>We're looking for someone to spend their year with us striving to make a positive impact on our clients' lives, and leaving with a wealth of knowledge, confidence and personal growth.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00B2B2">Person Specification:</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Proactive work ethic and independent thinker:</strong> we are a team and we are here to help each other. But once you're up and running you should feel comfortable to plan your own working day and prioritise your projects and work accordingly. Someone will always be only a phone call or cup of tea away!</li>
<li><strong>Strong interpersonal skills and ability to communicate:</strong> we are a close-knit bunch and the whole company has a short daily 'scrum' so we can catch up on the day to day business of each team. Our Marketing Director is always looking for new blog posts for our website, so if you have discovered something interesting within the tech world or something you're working on for example, this is definitely encouraged. Within the tech team we all chat online/in person regularly in order to share knowledge and skills or ask questions and get help. Don't be afraid to ask.</li>
<li><strong>Problem solving capabilities:</strong> that's what programming is - puzzles and problem solving! We don't expect you to know everything about everything, just need you to enjoy the process of learning, creating and programming. We have a fantastic tech team who are from a variety of different backgrounds and skills, but we all unite in our love for code.</li>
<li><strong>Passionate about learning new skills:</strong> as mentioned, software is constantly changing. We need someone who wants to learn and is humble enough to do so. We all learn from each other all the time, not just in coding but the complexities of our system and how doctors and nurses use it each day.</li>
<li><strong>A dog lover:</strong> we have an office puppy, Fig. He is super friendly and very affectionate, but will demand a pat or a cuddle from you every now and then, so it would help if you weren't allergic or scared. He has his own SARD branded jacket.</li>
