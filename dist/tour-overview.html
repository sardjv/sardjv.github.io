The following pages will take you through all of the elements of the site and help you to understand how the system can work for you.</p></div><div class="row marketing"><div class=col-lg-12><h1>Overview</h1><p>SARD was designed to mirror the Revalidation timeline followed by all NHS and healthcare organisations. In order to make this as clear as possible, we have broken the journey down into five simple steps.</p><p>The tour below highlights and identifies how the SARD system supports each section of the journey. In this overview, we'll quickly discuss what those five steps are and then go into more detail in the subsequent sections.</p><h2>****INSERT IMAGE****</h2><h2>The Five Step Revalidation Process</h2><ol><li><h4>Organisation prepares for revalidation</h4></li><p>SARD makes the configuration and installation of a revalidation system simple. In fact, nearly all the work is done for you straight out of the box. We recognise the problems involved with deployment and installation within an organisation because we're an NHS Trust and we've met similar obstacles. So when we created SARD, we kept it as simple as possible. When preparing for revalidation it's important that the system fits with your current processes, your existing data and the roles of your doctors. In SARD, this initial setup is done within the administration section of the site.</p><ul><li>Configure organisation datasets for GMP Portfolio based upon medical role</li><li>Store and import historical appraisals/MAG forms</li><li>Import doctor data from ESR or GMC</li><li>Upload electronic documents as an administrator</li><li>Complaints management</li><li>Serious Untoward Incident (SUI) management</li><li>360 Multi Source Feedback (MSF) management</li><li>GMC revalidation recommendation management</li></ul><p>Read more about getting your organisation ready for the GMC revalidation</p><li><h4>Doctors gather evidence</h4></li><p>After step one, the system is ready to use and your doctors can start to build their portfolio of evidence for appraisal. The portfolio of evidence on the Strengthened Appraisal and Revalidation Database system is based upon the Good Medical Practice portfolio published by the General Medical Council. The GMC's GMP Portfolio breaks down into four domains; each of which have three subdomains. Our portfolio displays this on a single page and prompts the doctor to add evidence that is deemed relevant to their medical roles.</p><p>Over the course of the year, doctors are able to maintain a portfolio of information that build ready for their appraisal at the end of the year. They can do this at any point during the year and any evidence that spans multiple years will carry through to the following appraisal year.</p><ul><li>Individual portfolios</li><li>Upload or enter supporting evidence</li><li>Red, Amber, Green status to track activity</li><li>Email reminders</li><li>Notifications</li><li>Populate CPD</li><li>Address Serious Untoward Incidents (SUIs)</li><li>Discuss complaint information</li><li>360 Multi Source Feedback (MSF) management</li></ul><p>Read more about doctors gathering evidence in their GMP portfolio</p><li><h4>Doctor Completes Appraisal</h4></li><p>Each year, SARD prompts doctors to complete the preparation sections of their appraisal form in anticipation of their appraisal meeting. The form follows the pattern outlined in the Revalidation Support Team's MAG appraisal form. The appraisal form includes the six types of supporting information expected by the General Medical Council:</p><ul><li>Continuing professional development (CPD)</li><li>Quality improvement activity</li><li>Significant events</li><li>Feedback from colleagues</li><li>Feedback from patients</li><li>Review of complaints and compliments</li></ul><p>Once the preparation sections are completed, the doctor can submit their appraisal form to their appraiser.</p><ul><li>Appraisal forms mapped as required</li><li>Portfolio evidence automatically populates the appraisal to save duplication</li></ul><p>Read more about the MAG based appraisal forms</p><li><h4>Appraiser Confirms Output</h4></li><p>As well as being able to manage their own appraisal forms and portfolio, appraisers have an appraiser dashboard that gives them an overview of all those whom they appraise. It alerts them to any upcoming appraisal meetings and the state of supporting evidence for their appraisees.</p><p>Once an appraisal has been submitted, the appraiser is able to access the appraisal form of a doctor and comment against each section, giving guidance and support where necessary until both doctor and appraiser are content to digitally sign the forms as complete.</p><ul><li>Appraiser dashboard to track progress</li><li>Red, Amber and Green status tracker</li><li>Notifications of activity</li><li>Appraisal decision forms</li></ul><p>Read more about the appraiser dashboard</p><li><h4>Responsible Officer Confirms Registration to the General Medical Council</h4></li><p>On completion of an appraisal form, the responsible officer will receive the appraisal summary sections only. These are clearly marked and the other sections of the appraisal form remain a private discussion between the appraiser and doctor and are not disclosed to the Responsible Officer.</p><p>A Responsible Officer has a 'Responsible Officer Dashboard' that provides an overview of revalidation and appraisal across the entire organisation. They are also able to drill down into finer detail to see appraisal at a directorate, or hospital level.</p><ul><li>Responsible Oficer dashboard</li><li>Tracking progress across the organisation</li><li>Notifications</li><li>QA status tracker (optional)</li></ul><p>Read more about the Responsible Officer dashboard</p></ol></div></div><script src=scripts/3eda25cb.vendor.js></script><!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. --><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
