Earlier this year, in response to requests from several of our users, we expressed our intention to hold a SARD User event Autumn 2018. I am now very pleased to confirm that this will take place on Friday October 19th at the <a href="https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/"> Royal College of Physicians.</a>

This all day event will be an opportunity for our users to hear first hand about our latest features and updates, as well as provide the chance to meet with other SARD users from across the country to share best practice.

We will also be previewing our brand new SARD eRostering and seeking user feedback to ensure it is tailored to your needs.

The day will start at 10am (registration from 9.30am) and lunch will be provided. 
During breaks there will also be the option of visiting the RCP Londonâ€™s upcoming exhibition:<a href="https://history.rcplondon.ac.uk/event/upcoming-exhibition-vexed-question-500-years-women-medicine">  "This vexed question": 500 years of women in medicine.</a>


We are currently negotiating a delegate discount with a nearby hotel for those that will require accommodation and I should be able to confirm details of this to attendees very shortly.

To reserve your place please email me at <a href="mailto:francesca@sardjv.co.uk">francesca@sardjv.co.uk</a>. Capacity is limited, so please book early.
