We are very pleased to announce that SARD have achieved certification to the internationally recognised ISO 27001 standard. SARD has always prioritised security in the data we process, and we are delighted to have our security management system officially recognised. 

ISO 27001 is the internationally recognised Information Security Management Standard that proves commitment to the security of customer and employee information. With ISO 27001 in place, we are able to minimise risks to potential data security breaches and reduce errors.

Independent assessment of our compliance was conducted by the British Assessment Bureau, a leading Certification Body, and demonstrates our commitment to keeping our data, staff and premises secure.
SARD has now earned the right to display the coveted British Assessment Bureau quality shield and ISO 27001 logo to demonstrate our conformance.

We hope that achieving the ISO 27001 standard will help to assure our existing and future clients that SARD is extremely secure and that we treat the protection of the information we are entrusted with as highest priority.

 
## About the British Assessment Bureau

The British Assessment Bureau’s reputation was established in 1969 as a specialist in certification scheme management. In 1997, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry approved the use of the word ‘British’ in their title, in recognition of their pre-eminent status.
Today, they certify organisations to recognised standards, including ISO 9001 (quality management), ISO 14001 (environmental management), ISO 27001 (information security management) and OHSAS 18001 (occupational health and safety management). They also design and manage bespoke assessment schemes. Such schemes are based on the establishment of standards, which can be developed to be recognised company-wide, industry-wide, nationally, or internationally.
