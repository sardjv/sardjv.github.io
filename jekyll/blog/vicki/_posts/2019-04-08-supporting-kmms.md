We are really excited to be involved in fundraising for such an exciting new development. Working with doctors every day, we recognise the vital importance of ensuring the future of the UK's healthcare workforce and with one of our offices being based on site at The University of Kent, it is very exciting to have this tremendous venture right on our doorstep - training future doctors who may be the people that deliver our babies, care for our sick loved ones, or even save our own lives.

We will be starting things off with a pre-Easter bake fest at both our Crystal Palace and Canterbury offices on Thursday 18th April. If you happen to be in the area, please feel free to pop in for a slice of cake!

We will keep you updated with fundraising plans but if anyone wants to get in touch to give us ideas of how you would like to see us raise money, then you can contact me at <a href="mailto:vicki@sardjv.co.uk">vicki@sardjv.co.uk</a>
