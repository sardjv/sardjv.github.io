		<h1>Appraiser Dashboards</h1>
		             
		<p>As well as being able to manage their own appraisal forms and portfolio, appraisers have an appraiser dashboard that gives them an overview of all those whom they appraise. It alerts them to any upcoming appraisal meetings and the state of supporting evidence for their appraisees.</p>

		<p>Once an appraisal has been submitted, the appraiser is able to access the appraisal form of a doctor and comment against each section, giving guidance and support where necessary until both doctor and appraiser are content to digitally sign the forms as complete.</p>
