        <title>Don&#39;t bring me solutions, bring me problems.</title>
        <description>Nearly all procurement requirements are defined by a presupposed solution. Consequently, very few succeed in solving the root problem as effectively and cheaply as possible. This is easily resolved by making the core problems the backbone of a requirement document.</description>

        <title>Great Customer Service begets Great Everything</title>
        <description>As a self-confessed geeky nerd and director of a technology company, you’d think my obsession would be engineering and science but it’s not. My nerdish obsession for the last 3 years has been customer service. I love it! I read and watch countless books and videos on the subject.</description>

        <title>Turning off the targeting computer</title>
        <description>When Apollo 11 took the first men to the moon, it was intended that the Lunar Module would land autonomously; guided entirely by computer. However, in the last 500ft, Neil Armstrong turned off the ‘targeting computer’. Although the site selection team had picked a smooth patch of ground, the state of the guidance art at the time was taking the LM into a field of boulders the size of a football field.</description>

        <title>Automatic Reminders</title>
        <description>Today we completed development on a new feature for SARD - an automated email system to manage reminders for doctors about their upcoming appraisal. This feature will further improve compliance rates and will also make the appraisal process a little more straightforward for our doctors and administrators. Reminders will take the form of a simple email, containing a link to create an appraisal or access their current one.</description>

But time flies and it’s now been several months since October 26th. We’ve rounded up our donations and we’re proud to announce we raised £923.43 for Mind in Croydon!</description>

        <title>Test-Driven Development for the Non-Programmer</title>
        <description>At SARD we practice Test Driven Development. If you are a software developer, you probably know what this is; if you are not, you almost certainly do not. But perhaps you should know, because it is an important idea that is becoming more and more relevant to all our lives. It has been said that TDD is as significant to software development as</description>
