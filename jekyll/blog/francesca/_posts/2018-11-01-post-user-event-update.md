excerpt: Thank you to everyone who came along to the SARD User Event on 19th October.

---
<p>On Friday 19th October we were delighted to welcome SARD users from across the UK to our annual user event at the Royal College of Physicians London.
We hope that all attendees found the day as useful and productive as we did and very much look forward to holding more events like this in the future.</p>
<p>We are currently working through all of our notes from the discussions, prioritising next steps and will be circulating these to all attendees (and those that could not make it but have asked to keep updated) as soon as possible. 
In the meantime, if you have any further questions or feedback from the day, particularly on how we can make it even more useful in the future, then please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:francesca@sardjv.co.uk">get in touch with us.</a></p>
