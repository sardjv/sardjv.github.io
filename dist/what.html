This will be familiar to doctors who have completed an appraisal using the interactive Adobe PDF form. The appraisal is linked to the SARD Portfolio, which is based on the GMP Portfolio. Relevant evidence from your portfolio is pulled directly into your appraisal form.</p><p>The SARD system is completely adaptable to your needs. For instance the portfolio can be tailored to your medical role and can be linked to your appraisal whichever way suits your preferences.</p><p>Evidence to your portfolio can be uploaded over a number of years. When it is time for your appraisal all the relevant documents are in one place; making the appraisal process cumulative rather than repetitive. The portfolio is based on the Good Medical Practice portfolio. You can mark your appraisal progress at every stage with the traffic light colour coding, as well as the “progress bar” which monitors the overall status of your revalidation. You can leave comments on each section to clarify the attached documents. The entire appraisal portfolio and all supporting evidence can be downloaded as a single ‘zip’ file or separate PDF files.</p></div></div></section><!-- Full Page Image Header Area --><div class=full-width-image style="background: url(/images/video_stills/phil_at_window.jpg) no-repeat; height: 450px"><div class=vert-text><h1><span class=highlighted>SARD: 360 Multi-source Feedback</span></h1><h3><span class=highlighted><span></span></span></h3></div></div><!-- /Full Page Image Header Area --><section id=msf-360><div class=container><div class=col-xs-12><h1>SARD: 360 Multi-source Feedback</h1><p>SARD:360 is our answer to Multi-Source Feedback.

SARD was designed and developed by Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust with all of your needs in mind. A system designed by health care professionals for healthcare professionals. As a pilot trust dissatisfied with the alternatives, we decided to create something home grown that did exactly what a trust requires. We are so proud of the outcome that we want to share it with you and in the process reinvest back into the NHS.</p><h4>Built by an NHS Foundation Trust</h4><p>SARD was specifically built for Revalidation. It’s not an afterthought or bolt-on. SARD is built from the ground up, meeting all the GMC requirements in the simplest way possible. SARD delivers for all user levels; responsible officers, appraisers, doctors and administrators. Covering evidence gathering, appraisal completion and appraisal outcomes whilst at the same time tracking activity and providing individual and organisational wide compliance.</p><h4>Easy to integrate; simple to use</h4><p>Integration of any new system can be painful due to the varied requirements of each individual organisation. Finding a solution that fits with your structures and processes can be difficult and as such organisations often find themselves working to the beat of the system, rather than the system working for them. SARD is different, it was built to be flexible and meet any unique requirements you have, however unusual. Highly configurable with minimum impact on usage and with its simple and easy to use interface, SARD is the complete package.</p><p><h2>Future Developments</h2></p><p>We believe in always moving forward and improving, and now we feel it is time to take the next logical steps in the development of our solutions after the success of Medical Revalidation. We wanted to share these exciting developments with you as well as offer (as usual) the opportunity to get involved.</p><h4>SARD Appraisal for All</h4><p>Developing our medical revalidation system has provided a great platform for making life easier for those undertaking the process of appraisal and revalidation. It has however led us to a pressing question, why restrict the platforms coverage? We wanted to take a different approach, and this logically led to the idea of expanding our platform to more staff in the NHS (and who knows in the future beyond). In fact we wanted to offer the platform to all staff. Appraisal is an important development process, and we want to help support it so it is meaningful and productive. We also understand that an appraisal is not just a once a year event, and to be truly useful it needs to be an ongoing process to help develop staff and look to the future. In order to facilitate this we need something that will support this process without drawing users in to overly complicated processes. For more information about this please contact any member of our team and watch this space.</p><h4>SARD Nurse Revalidation</h4><p>As part of our Appraisal for All platform, we will be building specific modules to cater for new and upcoming revalidation requirements specifically with a focus on Nurse Revalidation. As this is the next logical step we will strive as we have done on all of our previous undertakings to make this simple and straightforward.
