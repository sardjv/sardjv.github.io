excerpt: Why it is important to upgrade your browser.

Whatever browser you use, be it Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Internet Explorer, it is important to keep it up to date to get the latest security patches. If you are using Internet Explorer it is particularly important to use at least version 11 as <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/End-of-IE-support"  target="_blank"> earlier versions are no longer supported</a> by Microsoft.

If you are running version 8, 9 or 10 of Internet Explorer you put your whole system at risk of malware and cyber-attacks. Vulnerable browsers may facilitate the download of spyware that can capture passwords, credit card numbers and screenshots to pass along to hackers.

Internet Explorer 11 is the last version of Internet Explorer which will continue to receive security updates, compatibility fixes, and technical support. Regular security updates help protect computers from malicious attacks, so upgrading and staying current is important.

In addition, newer websites are often only supported by newer browsers. They may not function properly on older browsers and may fail to display parts of the website. Older browsers canâ€™t load component files such as images and programming scripts as fast as newer browsers. This may make websites considerably slower and can cause your browser to crash or freeze.

This summer will see <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/browsers-devices/"  target="_blank">SARD's new user interface</a> being rolled out. It's implemented using the popular Bootstrap framework which will allow SARD to be accessed more easily on mobiles and tablets. This is optimised for the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms. On Windows, Internet Explorer 10-11 and Microsoft Edge will be supported.
