excerpt: This week has been a very exciting week for us and for me. We have been building a new website to reflect all of the new exciting things we are doing. I have enjoyed really getting my teeth stuck into helping to build and design something that shows our current clients and potential clients what we are capable of, but more importantly why we do it. I often feel that businesses focus on a product, what they are building, but I don't think clients just look for what you can do, they want to see that you are doing it for the right reasons. For me it is about values, if we can bring our values to work and translate them in to building great things that we care about and believe in then by extension what we produce will be the best can be. I know people may question the idea of how you can care about building a system, and really what impact does it have, but to be honest the system is really the vehicle, it is believing in what you do and not just doing it because it is there. I have a firm held belief in trying to improve things, make them better and easier and that is reflected both inside and outside of work. I hope that the work we are doing with this internal website project reflects this.

This week has been a very exciting week for us and for me. We have been building a new website to reflect all of the new exciting things we are doing (which you will be reading this blog on). I have enjoyed really getting my teeth stuck into helping to build and design something that shows our current clients and potential clients what we are capable of, but more importantly why we do it. I often feel that businesses focus on a product, what they are building, but I don't think clients just look for what you can do, they want to see that you are doing it for the right reasons. For me it is about values, if we can bring our values to work and translate them in to building great things that we care about and believe in then by extension what we produce will be the best can be. I know people may question the idea of how you can care about building a system, and really what impact does it have, but to be honest the system is really the vehicle, it is believing in what you do and not just doing it because it is there. I have a firm held belief in trying to improve things, make them better and easier and that is reflected both inside and outside of work. I hope that the work we are doing with this internal website project reflects this. 

The other big news we have is the future and what we are filling it with, exciting new developments, all focused on the same principles, simplicity and effectiveness. We will be focusing on new areas surrounding Appraisal for all staff as well as Nurse Revalidation. So although I am loving this project and its challenges I can't wait to start on the next one and to see where that takes us.
