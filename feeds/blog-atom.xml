      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week has been a very exciting week for us and for me. We have been building a new website to reflect all of the new exciting things we are doing (which you will be reading this blog on). I have enjoyed really getting my teeth stuck into helping to build and design something that shows our current clients and potential clients what we are capable of, but more importantly why we do it. I often feel that businesses focus on a product, what they are building, but I don’t think clients just look for what you can do, they want to see that you are doing it for the right reasons. For me it is about values, if we can bring our values to work and translate them in to building great things that we care about and believe in then by extension what we produce will be the best can be. I know people may question the idea of how you can care about building a system, and really what impact does it have, but to be honest the system is really the vehicle, it is believing in what you do and not just doing it because it is there. I have a firm held belief in trying to improve things, make them better and easier and that is reflected both inside and outside of work. I hope that the work we are doing with this internal website project reflects this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other big news we have is the future and what we are filling it with, exciting new developments, all focused on the same principles, simplicity and effectiveness. We will be focusing on new areas surrounding Appraisal for all staff as well as Nurse Revalidation. So although I am loving this project and its challenges I can’t wait to start on the next one and to see where that takes us.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had some time off this month for an operation and was fortunate enough to be treated in the day surgery unit of Princess Royal University Hospital, now run by Kings College Hospital NHS FT. When my anaesthetist and her assistant asked me what I did, I don’t think they were expecting to be asked if they liked their appraisal software!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the anaesthetist had used SARD to complete her appraisal in April and said she liked the system very much. Unfortunately, I was out for the count before I could ask her for a full testimonial!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was hoping to get an MSF form to see it from the patient side. Maybe next time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2013 Kevin and I discussed the fact that we often ran into small technical problems and we realised that there must be a wealth of technical resource in our area. Crystal Palace is historically linked to the principles of advancing through science and technology and bringing all new innovation together in one place. Kevin, as you may expect, has a keen interest in all types of technology, and I have a passion for most things science (even the bad bits are usually fascinating). From this grew the idea of the Silicon Triangle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We put a poster up in our local pub, the Grape and Grain, on which we invited those with an interest in science and technology to join us in rekindling the spirit of the original Crystal Palace.  And on August 6th we got together. It was a modest group of people that responded, but it was a lot of fun. We all sat around, had a drink and chatted about our respective science &amp;amp; tech backgrounds. Kevin found people who inspired him to design different features for SARD and I found people who were happy to have me talk epigenetics at them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past 11 months the Silicon Triangle grew and interesting things kept coming up. People brought their new gadgets to the pub to show them off and in April one of the attendees even brought their own 3D printer with some printed models to show off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were really impressed with how many people the gathering attracted and how many return members we had. By now we started to realise that the Grape and Grain pub, though having been extremely hospitable, was no longer a suitable venue. We needed a place of our own! So after taking May off to rethink the way we were organising the Silicon Triangle. I went to a meeting at West Norwood’s The Open Works initiative (link: http://www.theopenworks.org/) to talk about a local maker space to see if perhaps the Silicon Triangle could relocate to this location, or if this would be a viable change. Unfortunately the Open Works’ maker space is still in such an early stage that this was not viable. I spoke to the people of the South London Maker Space (link: http://www.southlondonmakerspace.org/) to see what they had to offer, but at that point they were about to lose their space in Herne Hill (luckily by now they’ve found a more permanent location). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other question was whether we wanted a space where we could work on a project together, or we wanted a place where we could all socialise and perhaps listen to others talk about projects. With the 2 maker space options not entirely up to scratch, I decided that a room above a pub or similar venue would be perfectly fine for our purposes for now. And so I got in touch with the lovely people from the Antenna café (link: http://www.antennastudios.co.uk/cafe-thing/) who were up for hosting our night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We eventually returned on the 3rd of June with a new venue and a beautiful new poster design by Steve Horry that you can see as the title picture of this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I used to be like you…actually if you are reading this online, on a computer, I wasn’t like you, however if you have a friend cowering in the corner, afraid of the ghostly light of the screen, if you have a friend that watched ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’ one too many times as a child and now is mistrustful of all technology (regardless of whether it has creepy vocal intonations) I was that friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not that I don’t understand the incredible power and opportunity technology affords us, but I find it hard to understand or reason with something that doesn’t have a face! I enjoy human contact, you can’t charm a computer, binary code does not rhyme!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My transformation from luddite to cautious enthusiast has been tricky at times, often I would get confused in a conversation about ‘tech’ and just shout the word ‘motherboard’ over and over again until everyone stopped asking questions.
After years of repeatedly asking friends questions like ‘what is a Copy shortcut?’ (Cntrl+C by the way) or working the word ‘megapixel’ unnaturally into conversation (without having any idea of what it meant) I finally decided to learn ‘Internet’.
The first important lesson I learned was to stay calm, if someone asks your opinion on Ubuntu they are probably NOT trying to hex you (that’s hex the curse, not hex the base-16 number system, am I right!), you CAN ask questions, this was a revelation to me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Techies WANT to help you (sure they might judge you a little but this is more about them than you so don’t worry) and I also found out that the best you can do while learning was to ‘make mistakes’ and by god was I a natural at this. You couldn’t stop me making mistakes, for the first time I was gifted at something!
Then after a few months out of this primordial soup of ignorance crawled a man who can update software without visually perspiring, he can upload, reconfigure and modify with ease!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you just keep asking questions you eventually start knowing things, which is initially disconcerting but ultimately feels good, like gradually getting into a too hot bath. Now when I type into a password box and it replaces letters with little circles, I don’t assume it is witchcraft. I am slowly becoming one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today is my first day back in the office after a week in Portugal with my family. Getting back into the swing of things can be a challenge but today I was really keen to get back and getting cracking on setting up our charity events in aid of Mind in Croydon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several local businesses in the Crystal Palace area have already pledged their support and I am now working on pulling all the events together, including our Goldmine Treasure Hunt, Stand up to Stigma comedy event and the Great South Run, they should all be really fun events which we are all very much looking forward to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news it was great to come back and find out how the Nursing Appraisal Conference that Phil and Sophie exhibited at went. Its good to know that everyone there responded positively to our intention to launch Appraisal for All (name to be confirmed). It is good to know that we are continuing to meet genuine client need.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We recently attended the ‘Nursing Appraisal and Revalidation’ conference in London, which was a very useful and insightful event. Having a background plunged into the inner depths of medical revalidation and as a company looking to expand our systems to fulfill future requirements, this conference could not have come at a better time. I think there was a little nervousness about readiness, both from our persepctive and from those who will have to undertake this process. However this conference managed to highlight some important anxiety busters. Firstly, although things are moving quickly, no final decisions have been made, which is useful for us as we want to make sure we are part of the process and develop solutions that meet the actual need and not the percieved one. Secondly, it was clear that it was a well thought out process and the NMC were trying to ensure that Nurse revalidation met the requirements of nurses and was not just a carbon copy of revalidation for doctors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were plenty of other key points that were covered, none more so than the time line for delivery and the actual process requirements (still to be confirmed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found out that the consultation period for deciding the actual requirements (2nd part of the overall consultation) was still underway and would continue through the summer, ending in mid august 2014. This part of the consultation would outline the draft code, which is central to revalidation, as well as discuss the range of methods avaliable and be the deciding factor with regards to the actual revalidation model that would be used. The next step would be to run a series of pilots throughout 2015 with the aim to go live towards the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other main area of interest for us was how the revalidation process may look. There will be 4 key areas including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hours worked (350 over a 3 year period)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continuing Professional Development&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Self declaration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3rd party sign off. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was obvious there there are still a lot of decisions to be made and the detail needs to poured over but it seems that everything is on the right track, and like many of you we will be listening with a keen ear to find out how it will all fit together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the whole the conference was very useful, and we are glad that we atended. We are very excited about our development work and hope to be able to show you all the fruits of our labour in the near future. If you are interested in finding out more then please do not hesitate to contact us.&lt;/p&gt;
