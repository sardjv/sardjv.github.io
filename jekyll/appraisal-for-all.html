      <h1>Appraisal for All</h1>
      <p class="lead">At SARD we never stand still and continue to strive to improve, develop and innovate. This doesn't just mean making what we have better, but also developing new products. After spending a significant period of time perfecting our medical revalidation system and working with our clients it became very clear that there are further needs within our area of expertise. We felt our system could and should be extended to cover appraisal and revalidation requirements for all staff within the NHS. One system to meet all needs, which is why we are currently developing our platform to achieve this.</p>
