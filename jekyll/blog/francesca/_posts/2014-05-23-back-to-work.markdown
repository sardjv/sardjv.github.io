Today is my first day back in the office after a week in Portugal with my family. Getting back into the swing of things can be a challenge but today I was really keen to get back and getting cracking on setting up our charity events in aid of Mind in Croydon.

Several local businesses in the Crystal Palace area have already pledged their support and I am now working on pulling all the events together, including our Goldmine Treasure Hunt, Stand up to Stigma comedy event and the Great South Run, they should all be really fun events which we are all very much looking forward to.

In other news it was great to come back and find out how the Nursing Appraisal Conference that Phil and Sophie exhibited at went. Its good to know that everyone there responded positively to our intention to launch Appraisal for All (name to be confirmed). It is good to know that we are continuing to meet genuine client need.
