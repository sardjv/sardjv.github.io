It is a logical step as we already know our revalidation and appraisal system helps thousands of doctors and we felt that our system could further support other colleagues within the NHS. Project plans have been drawn up and development is about to start. We are very excited about what we can produce and more importantly how this can help organisations to run, record and report on appraisals for all staff.</p><h4>Sussex Community sign-up to use SARD</h4><p>We are proud to announce that Sussex Community NHS Foundation Trust has just recently signed up to use the SARD Revalidation and Appraisal system. Implementation is underway and we are looking forward to this new partnership.</p><h4>SARD launches new partnership with Mind in Croydon to promote mental health awareness</h4><p>We are delighted to be working with Mind in Croydon (link) to raise funds for people and their families living with mental health issues in our local area.</p><p>On 26 July we will be holding Gold Mind, a family treasure hunt in and around Crystal Palace. Entry will be charged at £5 per adult for teams of up to 6. Children go free. The starting line will be at Westow Park, where entrants will be able to collect their hunting packs and chat to the team from Mind in Croydon about their work.</p><p>In September we will be holding Stand Up to Stigma, a night of comedy in aid of this fantastic charity. More details to follow soon.</p><p>On 26 October Kevin, Phil, Sophie and Barbara from the SARD team will be taking part in the Great South Run, with all sponsorship raised also being donated to Mind in Croydon. The team can be sponsored online at www.justgiving.com/runningsard.</p><p>Mind in Croydon is a very active charity that works with people with mental health problems and their families in Croydon. It aims to increase understanding of the difficulties faced by those with mental health problems. Its various projects help to relieve social isolation, enable people to acquire skills for independent life and promote positive mental health.</p><p>More information can be be found on their website www.mindincroydon.org.uk.</p><p>Registered Charity number 1073880.</p><h2>Previous News</h2><h4>King's Fund Survey finds Systems and IT are key to Revalidation process - 05 November 2013</h4><p>The King's Fund has published the results of a survey conducted amongst 53 London-based Responsible Officers. The main objective of the survey was to capture the experiences and reflections of ROs in London.</p><p>One of the conclusions from the survey is the integral part IT systems play in a successful revalidation process. From the report:</p><p>"The Importance of systems and IT"</p><p>Most ROs in both the survey and the qualitative interviews referred to the importance for revalidation of having established systems and processes with their organisations.</p><p>Where organisations were viewed as having robust processes in place, ROs reported a positive overall experience."
