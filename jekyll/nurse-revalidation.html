      <h1>Nurse Revalidation</h1>
      <p class="lead">With the second round of consultation underway the NMC are pushing ahead with implementating revalidation for nurses, due to come into play by the end 2015, we are developing our platform to meet these needs for current and future clients. As you can see we are appraoching this in a slightly different way, by creating a platform that not only meets the needs of nurse revalidation but instead one that meets the appraisal and future revalidation needs for all staff. </p>
