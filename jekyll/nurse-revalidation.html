      <h1>Nurse Revalidation</h1>
      <p class="lead">With the second round of consultation underway the NMC are pushing ahead with implementating revalidation for nurses, due to come into play by the end 2015, we are developing our platform to meet these needs for current and future clients. As you can see we are appraoching this in a slightly different way, by creating a platform that not only meets the needs of nurse revalidation but instead one that meets the appraisal and future revalidation needs for all staff. </p>

      <h2>Development</h2>
      <p>Development of SARD's Nurse Revalidation system is underway and is tracking the same timeline of the NMC consultation and timetable to ensure that the solution meets the exact requirements and not the percieved ones. The system itself will be built on top of our new Appraisal for All offering, to ensure it has a powerful apprasial tool as well as all of the elements require for nurse revalidation.</p>

      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>SARD's nurse revalidation system will cover all of the aspect and requirements as set out by the GMC. This will include the ability to record evidence against the follow areas:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Continue to remain fit to practise by meeting the principles of the revised Code.</li>
        <li>Have completed the required hours of practice and learning activity through continuing professional development (CPD).</li>
        <li>Have used feedback to review and improve the way they work.</li>
        <li> Have received confirmation from someone well placed to comment on their continuing fitness to practise.</li>
      </ul>  
      
      <p>As with all of our systems, the main aim will be to provide a solution that easy to use, flexible and cost effective, but above all else our system will be well supported.

      <h2>Who is it for?</h2>
      <p>Our nurse revalidation system will be fit for purpose for all nurses both working within the NHS and those working outside of it. The system will generally be available to organisations that employ nurses and therefore have a responsibility to revalidate them. Information regarding how this works is available upon request </p>

      <h2>What are the benefits?</h2>
      <p>The benefits of utilising SARD are ......</p>

      <h2>When will it be ready?</h2>
      <p>Our nurse revalidation system will be ready for implementation in time for the pilots that will be running from the start of 2015. However should you wish to monitor and gain information regarding the development of the system, or even take part in it, simply contact us and we will gladly update you with our progress. Equally you can keep an eye on our blogs and news stories where we will release regular updates. </p>
