        <title>This Week</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This week has been a very exciting week for us and for me. We have been building a new website to reflect all of the new exciting things we are doing (which you will be reading this blog on). I have enjoyed really getting my teeth stuck into helping to build and design something that shows our current clients and potential clients what we are capable of, but more importantly why we do it. I often feel that businesses focus on a product, what they are building, but I don’t think clients just look for what you can do, they want to see that you are doing it for the right reasons. For me it is about values, if we can bring our values to work and translate them in to building great things that we care about and believe in then by extension what we produce will be the best can be. I know people may question the idea of how you can care about building a system, and really what impact does it have, but to be honest the system is really the vehicle, it is believing in what you do and not just doing it because it is there. I have a firm held belief in trying to improve things, make them better and easier and that is reflected both inside and outside of work. I hope that the work we are doing with this internal website project reflects this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other big news we have is the future and what we are filling it with, exciting new developments, all focused on the same principles, simplicity and effectiveness. We will be focusing on new areas surrounding Appraisal for all staff as well as Nurse Revalidation. So although I am loving this project and its challenges I can’t wait to start on the next one and to see where that takes us.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Customer service in our sleep</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had some time off this month for an operation and was fortunate enough to be treated in the day surgery unit of Princess Royal University Hospital, now run by Kings College Hospital NHS FT. When my anaesthetist and her assistant asked me what I did, I don’t think they were expecting to be asked if they liked their appraisal software!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the anaesthetist had used SARD to complete her appraisal in April and said she liked the system very much. Unfortunately, I was out for the count before I could ask her for a full testimonial!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was hoping to get an MSF form to see it from the patient side. Maybe next time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Silicon Triangle</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2013 Kevin and I discussed the fact that we often ran into small technical problems and we realised that there must be a wealth of technical resource in our area. Crystal Palace is historically linked to the principles of advancing through science and technology and bringing all new innovation together in one place. Kevin, as you may expect, has a keen interest in all types of technology, and I have a passion for most things science (even the bad bits are usually fascinating). From this grew the idea of the Silicon Triangle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We put a poster up in our local pub, the Grape and Grain, on which we invited those with an interest in science and technology to join us in rekindling the spirit of the original Crystal Palace.  And on August 6th we got together. It was a modest group of people that responded, but it was a lot of fun. We all sat around, had a drink and chatted about our respective science &amp;amp; tech backgrounds. Kevin found people who inspired him to design different features for SARD and I found people who were happy to have me talk epigenetics at them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past 11 months the Silicon Triangle grew and interesting things kept coming up. People brought their new gadgets to the pub to show them off and in April one of the attendees even brought their own 3D printer with some printed models to show off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were really impressed with how many people the gathering attracted and how many return members we had. By now we started to realise that the Grape and Grain pub, though having been extremely hospitable, was no longer a suitable venue. We needed a place of our own! So after taking May off to rethink the way we were organising the Silicon Triangle. I went to a meeting at West Norwood’s The Open Works initiative (link: http://www.theopenworks.org/) to talk about a local maker space to see if perhaps the Silicon Triangle could relocate to this location, or if this would be a viable change. Unfortunately the Open Works’ maker space is still in such an early stage that this was not viable. I spoke to the people of the South London Maker Space (link: http://www.southlondonmakerspace.org/) to see what they had to offer, but at that point they were about to lose their space in Herne Hill (luckily by now they’ve found a more permanent location). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other question was whether we wanted a space where we could work on a project together, or we wanted a place where we could all socialise and perhaps listen to others talk about projects. With the 2 maker space options not entirely up to scratch, I decided that a room above a pub or similar venue would be perfectly fine for our purposes for now. And so I got in touch with the lovely people from the Antenna café (link: http://www.antennastudios.co.uk/cafe-thing/) who were up for hosting our night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We eventually returned on the 3rd of June with a new venue and a beautiful new poster design by Steve Horry that you can see as the title picture of this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>SARD launches new partnership with Mind in Croydon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We are delighted to be working with Mind in Croydon to raise funds for people and their families living with mental health issues in our local area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be holding our Stand Up to Stigma event before the end of the year, a night of comedy in aid of this fantastic charity. More details to follow soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 26 October Kevin, Phil, Sophie and Barbara from the SARD team will be taking part in the Great South Run, with all sponsorship raised also being donated to Mind in Croydon. The team can be sponsored online at www.justgiving.com/runningsard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mind in Croydon is a very active charity that works with people with mental health problems and their families in Croydon. It aims to increase understanding of the difficulties faced by those with mental health problems. Its various projects help to relieve social isolation, enable people to acquire skills for independent life and promote positive mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More information can be be found on their website www.mindincroydon.org.uk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Registered Charity number 1073880.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>In Development - SARD announces development of Appraisal for all system</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;SARD are pleased to announce that it is further developing the capability of its platform to extend the system in order to cover the appraisal process for all staff. It is a logical step as we already know our revalidation and appraisal system helps thousands of doctors and we felt that our system could further support other colleagues within the NHS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project plans have been drawn up and development is about to start. We are very excited about what we can produce and more importantly how this can help organisations to run, record and report on appraisals for all staff.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>i-Luddite</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to be like you…actually if you are reading this online, on a computer, I wasn’t like you, however if you have a friend cowering in the corner, afraid of the ghostly light of the screen, if you have a friend that watched ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’ one too many times as a child and now is mistrustful of all technology (regardless of whether it has creepy vocal intonations) I was that friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not that I don’t understand the incredible power and opportunity technology affords us, but I find it hard to understand or reason with something that doesn’t have a face! I enjoy human contact, you can’t charm a computer, binary code does not rhyme!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My transformation from luddite to cautious enthusiast has been tricky at times, often I would get confused in a conversation about ‘tech’ and just shout the word ‘motherboard’ over and over again until everyone stopped asking questions.
After years of repeatedly asking friends questions like ‘what is a Copy shortcut?’ (Cntrl+C by the way) or working the word ‘megapixel’ unnaturally into conversation (without having any idea of what it meant) I finally decided to learn ‘Internet’.
The first important lesson I learned was to stay calm, if someone asks your opinion on Ubuntu they are probably NOT trying to hex you (that’s hex the curse, not hex the base-16 number system, am I right!), you CAN ask questions, this was a revelation to me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Techies WANT to help you (sure they might judge you a little but this is more about them than you so don’t worry) and I also found out that the best you can do while learning was to ‘make mistakes’ and by god was I a natural at this. You couldn’t stop me making mistakes, for the first time I was gifted at something!
Then after a few months out of this primordial soup of ignorance crawled a man who can update software without visually perspiring, he can upload, reconfigure and modify with ease!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you just keep asking questions you eventually start knowing things, which is initially disconcerting but ultimately feels good, like gradually getting into a too hot bath. Now when I type into a password box and it replaces letters with little circles, I don’t assume it is witchcraft. I am slowly becoming one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Leicestershire Partnerships</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We have been managing our medical appraisal and revalidation process through SARD JV since July 2013.  The system is easy to use, can be easily adapted and we’ve had some really positive feedback from our doctors using it.  The team at SARD JV are very helpful, responsive and dedicated to providing a system fit for purpose.  I would happily recommend SARD JV to any Trust looking for an e-system to manage its appraisal and revalidation process.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ipswich Hospital Jane</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My involvement with SARD is on a daily basis, I find the system is easily understood and effortlessly taught even to the most sceptical!  I receive more and more positive feedback from the doctors now using the system and as they enter year 2 its pleasing to hear how easy they are finding the system and indeed to whole process of appraisal. I cannot praise the staff at SARDjv enough, they are always very helpful and knowledgeable.  Most importantly to me they are always very open and show willingness to develop the system and accommodate suggestions of change to the system.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ipswich Hospital</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As an experienced appraiser using the original GMC approved documentation I had reservations about utilising the SARD software. These reservations were rapidly dispelled following the conduct of my first appraisal with the SARD documentation. It is really helpful that the web based access makes it so accessible whenever necessary and convenient. Since its adoption by my Trust the SARD team have responded positively to suggestions for improvements in its implementation. Significantly,  every single appraisee and my consultant colleagues have been very enthusiastic about using SARD. SARD has made the Revalidation process far more straightforward with its intuitive and disciplined approach.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Harrogate And District</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the administrator of the medical appraisal and revalidation processes in an acute Trust, I was looking for an efficient and straightforward online system to support both my functions and my doctors. SARD provides this in a way which concentrates on the essentials of the processes, with a support team constantly looking to build on the already excellent system, including incorporating improvements suggested by clients. My doctors and I also really value the real time online and telephone support. I commend SARD to any organisation looking for a first class and flexible system.&lt;/p&gt;
