![eRostering Prototype](/images/blog/alex/erostering_shifts_wider.png)

One of our key principles is agility - we use constant feedback to drive our development so that we can focus on what actually matters to our clients. We worked closely with Oxleas to build Appraisal, and GSTT to build our eLeave system. They were the key influencers on the project, helping us make decisions according to what was most important to them. They have the advantage of an application which has been built with their specific needs in mind, and we were able to build something that provably worked and added value in the real world, which we could then provide to other trusts.

One area which seems to be still ‘unsolved’ in the NHS is rostering. For example, [in 2015-16 the NHS spent £51 per taxpayer on locums to cover roster gaps](https://improvement.nhs.uk/resources/reducing-reliance-medical-locums-practical-guide-medical-directors/).

As such we’ve been working hard on building an initial eRostering prototype. Now we are looking to get feedback - we want to find out what is most important to our customers. What are your pain points and what is the biggest rostering problem you face? We are already in discussions with several trusts about this, but we want to open this up - whether or not you are already one of our clients, if you struggle with the systems you use for rostering, we want to hear from you.

Ultimately we’re looking for a trust, department or group of doctors who are willing to work with us to build a rostering system that really meets their needs.
