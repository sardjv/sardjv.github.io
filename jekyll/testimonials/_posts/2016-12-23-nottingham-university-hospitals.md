Our experience of working with the team at SARD has been very positive. Rob, our Implementation Manager, has been helpful and patient, and is very quick to respond to queries and minor issues which inevitably arise as we have familiarised ourselves with the system. The team has embraced suggestions for further improving it, and in cases where it is feasible, changes have already been introduced.  This responsive and personal service is SARD’s key strength – they are a pleasure to work with.
