excerpt: We intend to hold a SARD User event later in 2018.

---

In our February newsletter, Cheyne shared that <a href="https://www.sardjv.co.uk/blog/cheyne/2018/02/26/admin-refresher-sessions.html">our Support Team are now offering administrator training and refresher sessions</a>. We are really pleased that the response to this was extremely positive but also took note of the feedback that some of our clients would like to participate in an event where they can meet and share best practice with other SARD users.

For this reason we intend to hold a user event later 2018. More details are to follow but we intend for this to be a full-day event (lunch provided!) in a central location. We are really looking forward to the chance to gather your feedback and facilitate discussion not only regarding the use of SARD but also more widely around appraisal, revalidation, MSF and Job Planning.

Please email me at <a href="mailto:francesca@sardjv.co.uk">francesca@sardjv.co.uk</a> to express your early interest in attending and to make sure that you are kept informed of dates and plans as these are confirmed.
