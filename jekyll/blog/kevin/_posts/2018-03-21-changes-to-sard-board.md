We are sad to say goodbye to Ben Travis as Board Director at SARD following his move from his role as Chief Executive of Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust to become Chief Executive at Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust. 

Ben has been a Director at SARD since the company formed and has been instrumental in developing the partnership between Oxleas and Mango Swiss to grow SARD into the organisation that we are today. I am personally very grateful to him for all of his support and hard work to make our Joint Venture a success. He will be missed. I hope that as Lewisham and Greenwich are SARD users, our paths may still cross from time to time! 

Ben’s departure leaves a space on the SARD Board for a representative from Oxleas and I am absolutely delighted that Dr Ify Okocha has agreed to take on the mantel. 

Dr Okocha was responsible for the initial commissioning of the SARD system in 2010 and our move to a Joint Venture in 2012 to make our products available to other healthcare organisations. He has been one of SARD’s greatest supporters throughout and I am really looking forward to having the considerable benefit of his expertise as a Medical Director and Responsible Officer on the SARD Board.
