As we continue to build our efficient and robust API, we have decided to take the time to write an API User Guide document.
This document should give you a quick and easy understanding of the mechanics of making requests to our API.
Included is an explanation of the necessary headers needed as well as how request bodies and responses are formatted.

The User Guide can be found [here](https://sardjv.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/user_guides/SARD-User-Guide-API.pdf).

If you want to discover what endpoints are currently available, please check out our API documentation [here](https://demo.sardjv.co.uk/api-docs/index.html).
