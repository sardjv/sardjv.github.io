			<p>SARD:360 is our Multisource Feedback module. The module covers self assessment, colleague - and patient feedback.</p> 

			<p>The animation above illustrates the different options we offer for handling patient feedback.</p>

			<p>Colleague feedback and self-assessment are both collected via online questionnaires.</p>

			<p>The SARD:360 module provides doctors with an analysis that compares their scores against national benchmark data. A colour-coded system highlights any areas that may need to be discussed in either an appraisal or revalidation setting.</p>
