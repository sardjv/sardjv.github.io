	<p>For 2018, the team at SARD have decided to choose a charity to focus on fundraising for throughout the year.</p>

	<p>This year, our team have voted for Crisis and we are so excited to start fundraising. </p>

	<p>Crisis is the UK national charity for homeless people. I will be leading the organisation of this, as Charity Champion for SARD.</p>

	<p>Crisis is a charity close to my heart; I have volunteered with them, and have always cared deeply for the homeless and felt like I wanted to do more to help them.</p>

	<p>We will keep you all posted with our fundraising plans but if anyone wants to get in touch to give us ideas of how you would like to see us raise money for Crisis, then you can contact
	me at <a href="mailto:alice@sardjv.co.uk">alice@sardjv.co.uk</a></p>
