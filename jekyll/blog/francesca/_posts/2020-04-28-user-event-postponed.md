excerpt: The next SARD User event has been postponed until 2021.

---

Due to uncertainty at the current time around COVID-19, we have take the decision to postpone our next SARD User Event, originally scheduled for 3rd September 2020, to the new date of Thursday 4th March 2021.

Once again, the event will be held at the beautiful <a href="https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/"> Royal College of Physicians London </a> in Regent’s Park and we are extremely grateful to them for being so accommodating with our shift of date. 

Due to the popularity of our previous events, we are very fortunate to have secured the stunning and historic Dorchester Library for next year’s event. We hope this larger capacity venue will allow space for even more SARD users to meet and share best practice.

We will begin to take registrations to attend from September, however please hold the date in your diaries and feel free to get in touch with me at <a href="mailto:francesca@sardjv.co.uk">francesca@sardjv.co.uk</a> should you have any questions or suggestions.
