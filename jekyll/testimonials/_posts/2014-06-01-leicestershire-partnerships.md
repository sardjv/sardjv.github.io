We have been managing medical appraisal/revalidation and our job planning processes through SARD since July 2013. The systems are easy to use, can be easily adapted and weâ€™ve had some really positive feedback from our doctors using them. The team at SARD are very helpful, responsive and dedicated to providing a system fit for purpose. I would happily recommend SARD to any Trust looking for an e-system to manage its appraisal/revalidation and/or job planning processes.
