My involvement with SARD is on a daily basis, I find the system is easily understood and effortlessly taught even to the most sceptical!  I receive more and more positive feedback from the doctors now using the system and as they enter year 2 its pleasing to hear how easy they are finding the system and indeed to whole process of appraisal. I cannot praise the staff at SARDjv enough, they are always very helpful and knowledgeable.  Most importantly to me they are always very open and show willingness to develop the system and accommodate suggestions of change to the system.
