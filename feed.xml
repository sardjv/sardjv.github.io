        <title>Automatic Reminders</title>
        <description>Today we completed development on a new feature for SARD - an automated email system to manage reminders for doctors about their upcoming appraisal. This feature will further improve compliance rates and will also make the appraisal process a little more straightforward for our doctors and administrators. Reminders will take the form of a simple email, containing a link to create an appraisal or access their current one.</description>

        <title>Great South Run</title>
        <description>It seems like only yesterday that I crossed the finish line for the Great South Run as part of the SARD JV team. But time flies and it’s now been several months since October 26th. We’ve rounded up our donations and we’re proud to announce we raised £923.43 for Mind in Croydon!</description>

        <title>Slow Is Fast</title>
        <description>When I was at university I wrote essays. I wanted to be able to write them more quickly so I learned to touch-type, using the awesome typeonline site. My favourite part was the speed test - I found it addictive. My tendency was always to try and go as quickly as I could because that was what I wanted to achieve, but I also wanted 100% accuracy, so I would correct any mistakes I made as I went along.</description>

        <title>The Golden Circle</title>
        <description>Many companies can explain to you &#39;what&#39; they do; for us it is simple, we build software systems. Companies can also, importantly, tell you &#39;how&#39; they do it; again for us, we work with our clients and partners to create solutions that really meet the needs of the organisations using them. But what really sets a company apart is &#39;why&#39; they do it, and this for many is not an easy area to explain.</description>

        <title>Understanding Our Users</title>
        <description>Our mission at SARD JV is to develop solutions that really help our users, so understanding our users is central to what we do. As a way of boosting this, last Thursday we held the inaugural SARD User Group Event in our new office. It was a day of discussion and feedback from some of our key users, and also an opportunity for us to present some new features and products that we are currently developing.</description>

        <title>Running SARD</title>
        <description>This weekend Team SARD will be running the Great South Run in aid of Mind in Croydon. As our company is part owned by a mental health trust, we wanted to do something to raise awareness of mental health issues as well as give back to our community. We found out that the mental health charity Mind is a franchise charity and our local branch, Croydon, is in charge of both a charity shop that tries to integrate service users as well as provide services for those in need. We therefore felt strongly that Mind would be the best charity for us to support by giving back to the community and raising awareness of mental health.</description>
