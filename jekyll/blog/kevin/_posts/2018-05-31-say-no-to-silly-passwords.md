It might be worth reconsidering the password policy of your organisation. If you want a strong password try combining four common words [as this XKCD comic suggests](https://xkcd.com/936/).

According to [the author of one of the world's most sophisticated password hacking tools](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/97269), it is best to think of password strength in terms of **guesses per dollar**. What does this mean...

#### 4 words

"correct horse battery staple" - would cost half a million dollars to crack.

#### 5 words 
"quire piazza known soon thrips" - about 2 billion dollars

#### 6 words
"incident sidewall serif gradate agonize humor" - about 8 trillion dollars

##### 7 words

"winsome amoral flagpole fee ivan sadly lawgiver" the GDP of the world for 60'000 years.

##### 12 words

Many bitcoin wallet passwords use 12 words. There's literally not enough energy in the universe to crack them; even with a quantum computer.

### Summary

The great thing about using random dictionary words is that they're easy to remember because we can construct stories around them. Four common words is probably a good starting point for a password policy. Isn't that easier than r3Me8er1ng something more complicat3d?

One last piece of advice: use a random password generator and keep your passwords in a vault such as [1Password](https://1password.com/). Humans are [terrible at picking random words and numbers](http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2007/02/05/is-17-the-most-random-number/). As shown in the image below, if you ask people to pick a random number between 1 and 20, 20% will pick the number 17! Let the computer randomly pick the words then construct a story about them so you can memorise them. I bet you can remember the "**correct horse** seeing the **battery** with a **staple** in it" already.

P.S. Don't use "correct horse battery staple" as your password :)
