      <h1>Is working at SARD for you?</h1>

<h2 style="color:#00B2B2">Vision, Culture & Values</h2>

  <p>We know our most important assets are the people we work with. It is not just about having highly skilled and gifted team members (which we are happy to say we have), but more about surrounding ourselves with individuals who share our attitudes and values and want to achieve the same high standards and goals. Our people are the foundation of our business.</p>

  <p>Our company culture is open, relaxed, friendly, sociable, flexible, non-hierarchical, where you can work with a high level of autonomy and have the space to express yourself and speak your mind.</p>

  <p>As a company we also support Dan Pink’s view of employee motivation and the link with <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation">Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose.</a></p>


  <h4 style="color:#00B2B2">Autonomy</h4>

  Your need to control your own life. At SARD you will be given the scope to manage your own workload without having someone looking over your shoulder. However, should you require support from your fellow team members, you can rest assured that it will be at hand.</p>

  <h4 style="color:#00B2B2">Mastery</h4>

  Your desire to get better and better at something that matters. We are passionate about continuous development and support employees with role related training as identified through regular appraisals. You can be sure we are as passionate about your development as you are and will provide the necessary support.</p>

  <h4 style="color:#00B2B2">Purpose</h4>

  Your wish to contribute to a bigger picture. Our team are clear and passionate about the role we play in supporting the healthcare sector to ensure that the quality standards of medical staff and staff related workflow is delivered efficiently and effectively. We hope that you will share this sense of purpose too.</p>

  <h2 style="color:#00B2B2">Additional Benefits</h2>
<p>As a company providing appraisal software, we have a strong belief in the value of regular appraisal and offer all members of our team six monthly opportunities to reflect upon progress and the future direction of their careers with us. Pay is reviewed annually.</p>

<p>We hold quarterly team 'Away Days' for the whole company to meet, put forward items for discussion and contribute to future strategic direction.
We also organise regular less formal opportunities to socialise which have included regular team lunches, escape rooms, cocktail making and mini-golf.</p>

<p>The SARD team are currently fundraising for the brand new Kent and Medway Medical School which will open to its first cohort of students in September 2020. We have raised over £1300 to date with more events planned over the next few months. All members of our team are invited to participate in this by whatever means they are most interested be it running, jumping, baking or quizzing. Find out more about our fundraising efforts <a href="https://www.sardjv.co.uk/blog/vicki/2019/04/08/supporting-kmms.html">here </a> and <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/sard-jv">here.</a></p>

<h1>What Do Our Team Say?</h1>

<h2 style="color:#00B2B2">Lucie Nash - Software Developer</h2>

<p>"Working at SARD is unlike anywhere I’ve ever worked. The atmosphere is so relaxed, trusting and supportive that employees just want to work hard. I was welcomed in straightaway and trained up by a caring and passionate tech team, who have ignited my own love for the job.</p>

 <p>The communication within the whole company is stellar and everyone is valued for their uniqueness. We are all invested in the future of this company because we believe in its ethos and see how our clients love it.</p>

<p>SARD is doing something very, very right. It’s difficult not to love coming to work."</p>

<h2 style="color:#00B2B2">Alex Rudall - former SARD Product Developer</h2>

<p>"SARD took me on as a junior software developer and I was able to rapidly progress to a senior level due to the level of autonomy and support available.</p>

<p>If you’re independent, want to make a contribution, and willing to work hard, they will support you through thick and thin and go far beyond would most employers would do in order to help you. It's also a really good, friendly atmosphere, and a lot of fun. More importantly, there’s a real opportunity to improve the workdays of hardworking NHS staff. It's been my favourite job so far and has changed my life in manifold positive ways. Thanks!"</p>
