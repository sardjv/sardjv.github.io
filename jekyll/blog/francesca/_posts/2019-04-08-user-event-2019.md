<p>Following last year's extremely popular <a href="https://www.sardjv.co.uk/blog/francesca/2018/11/01/post-user-event-update.html"> User Event</a> we are very pleased to confirm that we will be holding a similar event on Thursday October 10th. Once again, this will be held at the beautiful <a href="https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/"> Royal College of Physicians London.</a></p>

<p>This all day event will be an opportunity for our users to hear first hand about our latest features and updates, as well as provide the chance to meet with other SARD users from across the country to share best practice.</p>

<p>The day will start at 10am (registration from 9.30am) and lunch will be provided. </p>

<p> This day is already proving very popular, with nearly half of places already reserved by previous attendees, so please book as soon as possible to avoid disappointment. To reserve your place please email me at <a href="mailto:francesca@sardjv.co.uk">francesca@sardjv.co.uk</a>.</p>
