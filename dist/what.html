In fact it was these solutions that led to the creation of the company in the first place. So far we have the following solutions:</p><h4>SARD: Medical Appraisal and Revalidation</h4><p>The SARD Appraisal system is based on the Revalidation Support Team’s GMC MAG form. This will be familiar to doctors who have completed an appraisal using the interactive Adobe PDF form. The appraisal is linked to the SARD Portfolio, which is based on the GMP Portfolio. Relevant evidence from your portfolio is pulled directly into your appraisal form. The SARD system is completely adaptable to your needs. For instance the portfolio can be tailored to your medical role and can be linked to your appraisal whichever way suits your preferences. Evidence to your portfolio can be uploaded over a number of years. When it is time for your appraisal all the relevant documents are in one place; making the appraisal process cumulative rather than repetitive. The portfolio is based on the Good Medical Practice portfolio. You can mark your appraisal progress at every stage with the traffic light colour coding, as well as the “progress bar” which monitors the overall status of your revalidation. You can leave comments on each section to clarify the attached documents. The entire appraisal portfolio and all supporting evidence can be downloaded as a single ‘zip’ file or separate PDF files.</p><h4>SARD: 360</h4><p>SARD:360 is our answer to Multi-Source Feedback. SARD:360 is based on the GMC patient, colleague and self assessment questionnaires. Doctors can suggest colleagues for their colleague feedback. The Administrator can then choose a subset of these suggestions to send the feedback forms to. SARD JV has several ways in which you can collect patient feedback data. For more information on the different ways in which you can use SARD to collect patient feedback data go to: http://www.sardjv.co.uk/sard-360-patient</p><h4>SARD: Job Planning</h4><p>The SARD:Job Planning system is a simple and intuitive, single form page that allows you to enter your PAs and add the time, location and description for each activity. As with the Portfolio and the Appraisal, the Job Plan automatically links the Job Content and Objectives sections of the Job Plan to the relevant sections of the Appraisal such as Scope of Work and PDP Objectives.</p><h4>SARD: Educators Appraisal</h4><p>Need Text</p><h2>Future Developments</h2><p>We believe in always moving forward and improving, and now we feel it is time to take the next logical steps in the development of our solutions after the success of Medical Revalidation. We wanted to share these exciting developments with you as well as offer (as usual) the opportunity to get involved.</p><h4>SARD Appraisal for All</h4><p>Developing our medical revalidation system has provided a great platform for making life easier for those undertaking the process of appraisal and revalidation. It has however led us to a pressing question, why restrict the platforms coverage? We wanted to take a different approach, and this logically led to the idea of expanding our platform to more staff in the NHS (and who knows in the future beyond). In fact we wanted to offer the platform to all staff. Appraisal is an important development process, and we want to help support it so it is meaningful and productive. We also understand that an appraisal is not just a once a year event, and to be truly useful it needs to be an ongoing process to help develop staff and look to the future. In order to facilitate this we need something that will support this process without drawing users in to overly complicated processes. For more information about this please contact any member of our team and watch this space.<h4>SARD Nurse Revalidation</h4></p><p>As part of our Appraisal for All platform, we will be building specific modules to cater for new and upcoming revalidation requirements specifically with a focus on Nurse Revalidation. As this is the next logical step we will strive as we have done on all of our previous undertakings to make this simple and straightforward.
