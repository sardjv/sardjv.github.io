Following a smooth and successful implementation of SARD JV at King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, the team at SARD JV did not stop listening to us. They still pay attention to our  comments and suggestions in order to have  a system that keeps meeting our requirements. The feedback from our medical and dental staff is great. The reporting feature on SARD JV is excellent and  it  has made my job a lot easier. Keep up the good work!
