We recently attended the 'Nursing Appraisal and Revalidation' conference in London, which was a very useful and insightful event. Having a background plunged into the inner depths of medical revalidation and as a company looking to expand our systems to fulfill future requirements, this conference could not have come at a better time. I think there was a little nervousness about readiness, both from our persepctive and from those who will have to undertake this process. However this conference managed to highlight some important anxiety busters. Firstly, although things are moving quickly, no final decisions have been made, which is useful for us as we want to make sure we are part of the process and develop solutions that meet the actual need and not the percieved one. Secondly, it was clear that it was a well thought out process and the NMC were trying to ensure that Nurse revalidation met the requirements of nurses and was not just a carbon copy of revalidation for doctors. 

There were plenty of other key points that were covered, none more so than the time line for delivery and the actual process requirements (still to be confirmed).

We found out that the consultation period for deciding the actual requirements (2nd part of the overall consultation) was still underway and would continue through the summer, ending in mid august 2014. This part of the consultation would outline the draft code, which is central to revalidation, as well as discuss the range of methods avaliable and be the deciding factor with regards to the actual revalidation model that would be used. The next step would be to run a series of pilots throughout 2015 with the aim to go live towards the end of the year. 

The other main area of interest for us was how the revalidation process may look. There will be 4 key areas including:
- Hours worked (350 over a 3 year period)
- Continuing Professional Development
- Self declaration
- 3rd party sign off.
