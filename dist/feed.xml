        <title>Turning off the targeting computer</title>
        <description>When Apollo 11 took the first men to the moon, it was intended that the Lunar Module would land autonomously; guided entirely by computer. However, in the last 500ft, Neil Armstrong turned off the ‘targeting computer’. Although the site selection team had picked a smooth patch of ground, the state of the guidance art at the time was taking the LM into a field of boulders the size of a football field.</description>

        <title>Automatic Reminders</title>
        <description>Today we completed development on a new feature for SARD - an automated email system to manage reminders for doctors about their upcoming appraisal. This feature will further improve compliance rates and will also make the appraisal process a little more straightforward for our doctors and administrators. Reminders will take the form of a simple email, containing a link to create an appraisal or access their current one.</description>

        <title>Test-Driven Development for the Non-Programmer</title>
        <description>At SARD we practice Test Driven Development. If you are a software developer, you probably know what this is; if you are not, you almost certainly do not. But perhaps you should know, because it is an important idea that is becoming more and more relevant to all our lives.
