        <title>In Development - SARD announces development of Appraisal for all system</title>
        <description>SARD are pleased to announce that it is further developing the capability of its platform to extend the system in order to cover the appraisal process for all staff. It is a logical step as we already know our revalidation and appraisal system helps thousands of doctors and we felt that our system could further support other colleagues within the NHS.</description>

        <title>The Golden Circle</title>
        <description>Many companies can explain to you &#39;what&#39; they do; for us it is simple, we build software systems. Companies can also, importantly, tell you &#39;how&#39; they do it; again for us, we work with our clients and partners to create solutions that really meet the needs of the organisations using them. But what really sets a company apart is &#39;why&#39; they do it, and this for many is not an easy area to explain.</description>

        <title>Understanding Our Users</title>
        <description>Our mission at SARD JV is to develop solutions that really help our users, so understanding our users is central to what we do. As a way of boosting this, last Thursday we held the inaugural SARD User Group Event in our new office. It was a day of discussion and feedback from some of our key users, and also an opportunity for us to present some new features and products that we are currently developing.</description>

        <title>Running SARD</title>
        <description>This weekend Team SARD will be running the Great South Run in aid of Mind in Croydon. As our company is part owned by a mental health trust, we wanted to do something to raise awareness of mental health issues as well as give back to our community. We found out that the mental health charity Mind is a franchise charity and our local branch, Croydon, is in charge of both a charity shop that tries to integrate service users as well as provide services for those in need. We therefore felt strongly that Mind would be the best charity for us to support by giving back to the community and raising awareness of mental health.</description>

        <title>The Dichotomy of Appraisals</title>
        <description>Appraisals are not a new concept within the NHS (or indeed in any organisation for that matter), but hand on heart how many of us can say they are effective and meaningful? If we are honest appraisals for most individuals are seen largely as a waste of time, and are treated by many organisations as a tick box exercise driven by compliance and percentages, with little or no impact, other than to be mistakenly seen as a performance management tool.</description>

        <title>Annual Organisational Audit and the QIT</title>
        <description>Responsible Officers and revalidation administrators will be aware that the ORSA document is in the process of being replaced by the Annual Organisational Audit (Annex B) and Quarterly Information Template (Annex C). At SARD we&#39;re endeavouring to ease the process of completing both Annex B and Annex C so that the numbers required are available at the touch of a button.</description>

        <title>This Week</title>
        <description>This week has been a very exciting week for us and for me. We have been building a new website to reflect all of the new exciting things we are doing. I have enjoyed really getting my teeth stuck into helping to build and design something that shows our current clients and potential clients what we are capable of, but more importantly why we do it. I often feel that businesses focus on a product, what they are building, but I don&#39;t think clients just look for what you can do, they want to see that you are doing it for the right reasons. For me it is about values, if we can bring our values to work and translate them in to building great things that we care about and believe in then by extension what we produce will be the best can be. I know people may question the idea of how you can care about building a system, and really what impact does it have, but to be honest the system is really the vehicle, it is believing in what you do and not just doing it because it is there. I have a firm held belief in trying to improve things, make them better and easier and that is reflected both inside and outside of work. I hope that the work we are doing with this internal website project reflects this.</description>

        <title>Customer service in our sleep</title>
        <description>I had some time off this month for an operation and was fortunate enough to be treated in the day surgery unit of Princess Royal University Hospital, now run by Kings College Hospital NHS FT. When my anaesthetist and her assistant asked me what I did, I don&#39;t think they were expecting to be asked if they liked their appraisal software!</description>

        <title>Silicon Triangle</title>
        <description>In the summer of 2013 Kevin and I discussed the fact that we often ran into small technical problems and we realised that there must be a wealth of technical resource in our area. Crystal Palace is historically linked to the principles of advancing through science and technology and bringing all new innovation together in one place. Kevin, as you may expect, has a keen interest in all types of technology, and I have a passion for most things science (even the bad bits are usually fascinating). From this grew the idea of the Silicon Triangle.</description>

        <title>i-Luddite</title>
        <description>If you just keep asking questions you eventually start knowing things, which is initially disconcerting but ultimately feels good, like gradually getting into a too hot bath. Now when I type into a password box and it replaces letters with little circles, I don’t assume it is witchcraft. I am slowly becoming one of them.</description>

        <description>Today is my first day back in the office after a week in Portugal with my family. Getting back into the swing of things can be a challenge but today I was really keen to get back and getting cracking on setting up our charity events in aid of Mind in Croydon.</description>
