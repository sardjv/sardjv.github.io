As a self-confessed geeky nerd and director of a technology company, you’d think my obsession would be engineering and science but it’s not. My nerdish obsession for the last 3 years has been customer service. I love it! I read and watch countless books and videos on the subject.

Perhaps previously, I’d considered it to be an ‘additional feature’ or the ‘icing on the cake’ of exemplary engineering. It could even be an indicator of poor quality engineering… for example, if you purchased a well renowned, high precision, reliable car and on the way out of the door, the salesman hands you a 2 year warranty - “just in case it breaks and here’s my phone number should you have any problems. Good luck!”. Good customer service, documentation and warranties are an admission of guilt: “we’ll annoy you!”, “we make mistakes!”, “our products need explaining!, “our stuff breaks!”

To make matters worse, customer service seems to be even more dire in engineering and sciences. I expect great customer service in a hotel and yet, weirdly, I don’t expect it with software, builders, engineers or even doctors. And understandably so because we STEM workers aspire to be craftsman. “You want great customer service? I’ll give it to you! I’ll make it bigger stronger, faster, taller than before, it will never break, I’ll never make mistakes and my judgement will be beyond reproach.” Who needs support if it’s not going to fall over?

Except it does fall over. However perfect we are as craftsman; there will always be areas for improvement. And as customers, we know this. This is why we have The Service Recovery Paradox where customers value a service more once they have seen successful resolution of a problem.

My 3 year old epiphany was to recognise the reverse causation. Bad technology doesn’t require great support. Great support requires great technology. Great customer service begets great technology and agility by opening the door for criticism. This is why we had an online chat system from day one. Great customer service begets fitness-for-purpose and collaboration by living in the shoes of your users. Fitness-for-purpose begets cost-effectiveness and productivity by solving real world problems. Great Customer Service begets Great Everything and that’s why it will always be at the forefront of everything we do at SARD.
