			  <p>Every doctor undertaking the appraisal and revalidation process will have their own unique portfolio which is mapped as the organisation wishes to their specific revalidation requirements. The portfolio not only outlines what those requirements are but allows evidence gathering both on and offline to be associated with single or multiple datasets. SARD allows the doctor to build up a clear picture of their progress and also allows them to present that in a clear and efficient way to their appraiser or responsible officer.</p>

				<p>The portfolio itself is all held on a single page to avoid the need to constantly click around to either find old evidence or upload new. Simple colour coding, using a Red, Amber and Green rating, further adds to the simplicity of both recording activity and reviewing overall status. We have worked hard to ensure that attaching evidence is easy and straight forward to avoid time consuming , labour intensive processes. We also understand at SARD JV that evidence can come in many forms, and as such SARD does not discriminate against different types of media or indeed amount of documentation you are able to upload to the system. Finally the portfolio that you create will not only build a history of your activity over the years but will allow you to take this information with you should you ever leave your organisation and join a new one.</p>
