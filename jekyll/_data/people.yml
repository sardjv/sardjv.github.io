    <p>Throughout my working career, both in the NHS and outside of it,
     it has always been a passion of mine to make things better, tobe 
     part of something that has a positive impact. The premise is always 
     the same, invest time in improving the things we have to do, make 
     the small things easy to eventually make the big things easy, and 
     working for SARD is the epitome of this.</p>
     
    <p>I have always felt that it is important to understand why we do 
    things, asking the important questions and get to the real nub of 
    the questions in order to produce the best answers. If my skills and 
    knowledge, combined with those around me can help have a positive 
    impact on the organisations we are working with then I have started 
    to achieve my goals.</p> 
    
    <p>I have worked in both the private and the public sector over the 
    last 16 years, and prior to working with SARD JV I spent 5 years in 
    the NHS, creating positive change and living the day to day, 
    challenges as well as witnessing the challenges that others faced. 
    My last role was Head of Learning and Development at Oxleas NHS 
    Foundation Trust, a very different role to the one I am in now.</p>  
    
    <p>As like many of my colleagues, I like to indulge in activities 
    outside of work, and I am currently finishing off a number of writing 
    projects, which I find both relaxing and rewarding. Who knows one 
    day you may get to read some of my work when they are on the 
    bestsellers list.

    <p>Hello! I'm Sophie and I am one of the account managers at 
    SARD JV.  In fact, I was the very first account manager SARD 
    JV ever had. When I joined the company in November 2012, SARD 
    was on the verge of growth and it was very exciting. I was 
    there when the first big contacts came in, when it became 
    clear that SARD JV was not just a small player in a big field, 
    but could actually make a difference.</p>
    
    <p>For me the way SARD JV is different than anywhere I've 
    ever worked before is that our customer service is not just 
    a meaningless slogan. No one in this company reads from 
    scripts or waves away queries. We are all invested in our 
    solutions and we're all invested in making sure that our 
    clients and end users like our systems as much as we do.</p>
    
    <p>Before I came to SARD JV I completed an MSc in Science 
    Communication, which is an interest I still hold dear. Which 
    is why Kevin and I run a monthly science and technology meet-up 
    in Crystal Palace, called the Silicon Triangle, where we get 
    together with like minded people and talk about the projects 
    we are working on. Listening to the enthusiasm of others is 
    always inspiring and often helps us innovate our solutions as well.</p>
    
    <p>Besides this I write science stories on sciphie.wordpress.com 
    and am the sub-editor of the zine ‘You've Got Mail' 
    (http://gotmailzine.wordpress.com/)</p>

    <p>I am an account manager for SARD JV which gives me hands on 
    experience with people using the system every day, whether this 
    is improving and streamlining our system to the specific needs 
    of a client or problem solving on our online chat feature.</p>
    <p>As we are a relatively small company it means that we all 
    feel a very personal stake in the companies activities, whether 
    that is dealing with clients, testing systems or organizing 
    charity events.</p>
    
    <p>Because we are very open as a company it means as employees 
    we can each tailor our work according to our own strengths 
    and what we most enjoy.</p>
    
    <p>Having studied at both Sussex University and University of 
    East London, I spent 6 years working in the world of Optics 
    in various different ways. This has instilled an interest in 
    the ways different institutions and industries can collaborate 
    and find mutual goals.</p>
    
    <p>I feel we are in an interesting position being a joint venture 
    with an NHS trust, we are both part of the NHS framework but have 
    the freedom to really get to the core of problems and provide 
    innovative and fresh solutions.</p>
    
    <p>In my time away from work I run a storytelling night in 
    Crystal Palace, I have been involved in writing and performing 
    for many years, including participating in the Edinburgh and 
    Brighton Fringes Festivals.</p>

    <p>Hi, I&#39;m Barbara and I&#39;m a senior developer at SARD JV.</p>
    
    <p>I have been working in software engineering for over 15 years 
    and I hope that my experience brings a lot of value to what we are 
    doing. Our small team is great to work with and you can see that 
    everyone here really cares about the products that we build.</p>
    
    <p>I have been here right from the start, joining after a short 
    career break to have children. I have helped to build the system 
    from the bottom up. I think it’s essential to have a solid understanding 
    of the whole code and it means that together with the rest of the team 
    I can quickly appraise and react to new client requirements. In fact, 
    in my opinion, that responsiveness is what sets us apart from 
    our competitors.</p>
    
    <p>I typically work from home on the Isle of Wight, which is a beautiful 
    place to live, especially if you enjoy the great outdoors. If I’m not 
    coding or managing the family then you will probably find me out running 
    along the local beach.</p>

    <p>I first started working with SARD in the earliest days when Kevin 
    asked me to come along to a meeting to input into early research and 
    marketing plans. I loved the atmosphere and the customer service ethos 
    of the company and started working as permanent Head of Research and 
    Events shortly afterwards.</p>
    
    <p>I have worked in HR and candidate research within both the public 
    and private sectors and prior to joining SARD spent four years as a 
    fundraising manager for the NSPCC, supporting their National Development 
    Board, delivering gala fundraising events and working with major corporate 
    partners. These varied experiences have helped provide a good 
    understanding how large organisations work and the vital importance of 
    providing clients with the best possible customer service.</p>
    
    <p>Outside of work, I am Secretary to the Board of Trustees for 
    Beckenham Theatre and part of the founding group for Crystal Palace 
    Primary School, a new school that parents in the local area are hoping 
    to open in 2015.</p>
    
    <p>I work in the SARD office part-time and for the rest of the week I 
    look after my lively three year old which certainly keeps me busy! I 
    am very proud to work for SARD and excited about our future direction.</p>

    <p>I'm Naomi and I'm the Office Manager at SARD JV.</p>
    
    <p>I'm only here a few days a week - sorting out the paperwork, making 
    sure everyone gets paid and filing whatever needs to be filed - but I 
    always look forward to my time catching up with the team in the SARD 
    office. Unlike so many companies, there's a real culture of ‘pitching in' 
    here, and as well as my regular tasks I know my way around the 
    revalidation system and often jump in to help on the LiveChats. No 
    two days are the same, and that's part of what makes this such a dynamic 
    and innovative company to work for.</p>
    
    <p>I studied Drama at university before working in theatre facilities 
    management and then spent several years running the head office of a 
    cocktail bar chain before landing at SARD. Industries may differ, but 
    the core values of customer service and integrity of product are what 
    I look for in a workplace and SARD has these in abundance.</p>
    
    <p>Like many of the team here, I have a creative side and I exercise this 
    in my local theatre company and in front of my trusty sewing machine. </p>

    <p>I am one of the Directors here at SARD, and also the Director of Finance 
    at Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust.  From the moment we started discussing the 
    creation of SARD JV, I have been impressed by the team who have dedicated 
    themselves to the SARD system. Not only does it look fantastic, it's also 
    very easy to use.</p>
    
    <p>I've felt privileged to be involved in the setting up of this company and 
    the journey to becoming a viable and self-sufficient business - which we now 
    are. I put this down to a great system, a relentless focus on customer service, 
    delivered by talented people who really care.</p>
    
    <p>I joined the NHS in 2005, having previously worked at Arthur Andersen 
    and Heineken; and started at Oxleas in 2011.</p>

    <p>I make a living from working with startup and early-stage businesses, so I 
    have to choose who I work with very carefully. I chose to engage with SARD JV 
    because I saw in its founder, Kevin Monk, a genuine passion and commitment to 
    build a sustainable business for the long-term, and in its co-founder, Oxleas 
    NHS Foundation Trust, then his client, a willingness to think outside the box 
    in how to achieve their goals. We negotiated a joint-venture agreement, and 
    have moved through the tricky start-up phase into a fully self-sustaining and 
    rewarding business for all involved, in which the personal qualities which 
    first attracted me are now firmly rooted in the culture of the company: SARD JV 
    is caring, forward-looking, responsive and adaptive.</p>
    
    <p>With 30 years experience, spread equally over public and private sectors, 
    I'm the gray-hair in the team, and help balance the perspectives of the 
    stakeholders, maximise alignment of interests and avoid the common pitfalls in 
    a growth-oriented business. Starting out as an academic theoretical chemist, 
    my earlier career has moved through: systems programming, software development, 
    intelligence and security services interests in technology, technology research 
    & development programmes, government contracting, the introduction of digital 
    television, digital convergence and regulation, and business development, 
    finance, venture capital investment, turnaround and exit (M&amp;A/Flotation).</p>
    
    <p>I founded Haven Ventures in the UK in 2002, and we now operate the same model 
    of collaborative business development, investment and turnaround services in 
    the UK and six countries in Latin America and more recently Africa.</p>
