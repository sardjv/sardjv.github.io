They are dedicated to providing us with good service and are proactive in meeting our needs. At every phase, from contract negotiations to information governance, they have provided the highest standard of service. SARD JV is an organisation that we are delighted to be working with and they have a system we would happily recommend to any other NHS Trusts or designated bodies based on our experience to date.

As a result of our comprehensive procurement process SARD was chosen as the system most suited to our needs. All of our subsequent dealings with SARD JV have so far reinforced that view.

SARD is not a ‘one size fits all’ product, but rather a flexible system, which can be adapted to match our Trust’s particular requirements. We were consulted at every stage of the implementation of the system and our requests were integrated as required. The online live chat support facility that SARD JV offers has been well received by our doctors, as it provides an instant human response to any queries that they have.

Beyond the technical and support aspects, we have found the SARD JV team to be very easy to work with. They are dedicated to providing us with good service and are proactive in meeting our needs. At every phase, from contract negotiations to information governance, they have provided the highest standard of service.

SARD JV is an organisation that we are delighted to be working with and they have a system we would happily recommend to any other NHS Trusts or designated bodies based on our experience to date.
