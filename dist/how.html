These create the foundations of how we work and get the best results for those we are working with.</p><p>SARD JV, started long before the joint venture was officially set up. Oxleas NHS FT and Mango Swiss had already collaborated on a number projects which went on to shape we operate now. Early on, we thought long and hard about how we could achieve the best results and found them to be surprisingly simple. First and foremost we would foster a collaborative approach to WHY we were undertaking a project. We want to understand for both ourselves and our clients what the tangible impact of our work would be and the benefits to the organisation requesting it.</p><p>In order to achieve this, there were two very clear principles we would follow:</p><ul><li>Only produce solutions in partnership, never in isolation.</li><li>Above all listen to our clients - only once we have listened, are we able to offer our knowledge, skills and expertise in the most useful way.</li></ul><p>Simplicity is paramount. Our solutions are designed to be intuitive and are built to help, not hinder. If a system requires large scale user training, then it is too complicated. We want what users want, systems that help them carry out a task quickly, easily and efficiently, so they can get back to the other aspects of their roles.</p><p>So how do we ensure our team are effective in delivering this? Again that is simple. Through three straightforward principles: Mastery; Autonomy and Purpose.</p><ul><li>All of our team are master users of the solutions we provide. We live and breathe them throughout the working day.</li><li>All of our team members have autonomy and work self-directively. We take full ownership of the work we do.</li><li>We all have a shared understanding of the purpose of our business and full agreement on what we want to create and achieve.</li></ul><h1>Asking Why</h1><p>At SARD we pride ourselves on our ingenuity and innovation, in fact it is how we started - designing solutions to problems that were deemed too hard to resolve by some. However we equally pride ourselves on our integrity and therefore before we start working on a project we always want our clients to ask themselves why they are doing what they are doing and what they hope to achieve?</p><p>It is to help draw from our clients’ expertise to understand the key outcomes and provide solutions that are meaningful and effective.</p><p>Asking ‘why’ is something we do on a daily basis to ensure that we produce the best work possible. Challenge leads to change.</p><h1>News, Events and Blogs</h1><h2>News</h2><h4>In Development - SARD announces development of Appraisal for all system</h4><p>SARD are pleased to announce that it is further developing the capability of its platform to extend the system in order to cover the appraisal process for all staff. It is a logical step as we already know our revalidation and appraisal system helps thousands of doctors and we felt that our system could further support other colleagues within the NHS. Project plans have been drawn up and development is about to start. We are very excited about what we can produce and more importantly how this can help organisations to run, record and report on appraisals for all staff.<h4>Sussex Community sign-up to use SARD</h4></p><p>We are proud to announce that Sussex Community NHS Foundation Trust has just recently signed up to use the SARD Revalidation and Appraisal system. Implementation is underway and we are looking forward to this new partnership.<h4>SARD launches new partnership with Mind in Croydon to promote mental health awareness</h4></p><p>We are delighted to be working with Mind in Croydon (link) to raise funds for people and their families living with mental health issues in our local area. On 26 July we will be holding Gold Mind, a family treasure hunt in and around Crystal Palace. Entry will be charged at £5 per adult for teams of up to 6. Children go free.

We have been building a new website to reflect all of the new exciting things we are doing. I have enjoyed really getting my teeth stuck into helping to build and design something that shows our current clients and potential clients what we are capable of, but more importantly why we do it. I often feel that businesses focus on a product, what they are building, but I don't think clients just look for what you can do, they want to see that you are doing it for the right reasons. For me it is about values, if we can bring our values to work and translate them in to building great things that we care about and believe in then by extension what we produce will be the best can be. I know people may question the idea of how you can care about building a system, and really what impact does it have, but to be honest the system is really the vehicle, it is believing in what you do and not just doing it because it is there. I have a firm held belief in trying to improve things, make them better and easier and that is reflected both inside and outside of work. I hope that the work we are doing with this internal website project reflects this. The other big news we have is the future and what we are filling it with, exciting new developments, all focused on the same principles, so although I am loving this project and its challenges I can't wait to start on the next one and to see where that takes us.</p></div></div></div><div class="col-xs-6 col-md-3"><div class=thumbnail><a href=#><img src=image alt="Generic placeholder thumbnail"></a><div class=caption><h3>Nicholas Cooke</h3><p>NC Blog Text here</p></div></div></div><div class="col-xs-6 col-md-3"><div class=thumbnail><a href=#><img src=image alt="Generic placeholder thumbnail"></a><div class=caption><h3>Sophie Buijsen</h3><p>SB Blog Text here</p></div></div></div><div class="col-xs-6 col-md-3"><div class=thumbnail><a href=#><img src=image alt="Generic placeholder thumbnail"></a><div class=caption><h3>Kevin Monk</h3><p>KM Blog Text here</p></div></div></div><div class="col-xs-6 col-md-3"><div class=thumbnail><a href=#><img src=image alt="Generic placeholder thumbnail"></a><div class=caption><h3>Francesca Wilson</h3><p>FW Blog Text here</p></div></div></div></div></div><h4><a href=blogs.html>Read all of our blogs</a></h4></div><div class=footer><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-heart"></span> from the Yeoman team</p></div><script src=scripts/3eda25cb.vendor.js></script><!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. --><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
