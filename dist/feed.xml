        <title>Automatic Reminders</title>
        <description>Today we completed development on a new feature for SARD - an automated email system to manage reminders for doctors about their upcoming appraisal. This feature will further improve compliance rates and will also make the appraisal process a little more straightforward for our doctors and administrators. Reminders will take the form of a simple email, containing a link to create an appraisal or access their current one.</description>

        <title>Great South Run</title>
        <description>It seems like only yesterday that I crossed the finish line for the Great South Run as part of the SARD JV team. But time flies and it’s now been several months since October 26th. We’ve rounded up our donations and we’re proud to announce we raised £923.43 for Mind in Croydon!</description>

        <title>Test-Driven Development for the Non-Programmer</title>
        <description>At SARD we practice Test Driven Development. If you are a software developer, you probably know what this is; if you are not, you almost certainly do not. But perhaps you should know, because it is an important idea that is becoming more and more relevant to all our lives. It has been said that TDD is as significant to software development as</description>

        <title>Slow Is Fast</title>
        <description>When I was at university I wrote essays. I wanted to be able to write them more quickly so I learned to touch-type, using the awesome typeonline site. My favourite part was the speed test - I found it addictive. My tendency was always to try and go as quickly as I could because that was what I wanted to achieve, but I also wanted 100% accuracy, so I would correct any mistakes I made as I went along.</description>
