        <title>In Development - SARD announces development of Appraisal for all system</title>
        <description>SARD are pleased to announce that it is further developing the capability of its platform to extend the system in order to cover the appraisal process for all staff. It is a logical step as we already know our revalidation and appraisal system helps thousands of doctors and we felt that our system could further support other colleagues within the NHS.</description>

        <title>Annual Organisational Audit and the QIT</title>
        <description>Responsible Officers and revalidation administrators will be aware that the ORSA document is in the process of being replaced by the Annual Organisational Audit (Annex B) and Quarterly Information Template (Annex C). At SARD we&#39;re endeavouring to ease the process of completing both Annex B and Annex C so that the numbers required are available at the touch of a button.</description>

        <title>This Week</title>
        <description>This week has been a very exciting week for us and for me. We have been building a new website to reflect all of the new exciting things we are doing. I have enjoyed really getting my teeth stuck into helping to build and design something that shows our current clients and potential clients what we are capable of, but more importantly why we do it. I often feel that businesses focus on a product, what they are building, but I don&#39;t think clients just look for what you can do, they want to see that you are doing it for the right reasons. For me it is about values, if we can bring our values to work and translate them in to building great things that we care about and believe in then by extension what we produce will be the best can be. I know people may question the idea of how you can care about building a system, and really what impact does it have, but to be honest the system is really the vehicle, it is believing in what you do and not just doing it because it is there. I have a firm held belief in trying to improve things, make them better and easier and that is reflected both inside and outside of work. I hope that the work we are doing with this internal website project reflects this.</description>

        <title>Customer service in our sleep</title>
        <description>I had some time off this month for an operation and was fortunate enough to be treated in the day surgery unit of Princess Royal University Hospital, now run by Kings College Hospital NHS FT. When my anaesthetist and her assistant asked me what I did, I don&#39;t think they were expecting to be asked if they liked their appraisal software!</description>

        <title>Silicon Triangle</title>
        <description>In the summer of 2013 Kevin and I discussed the fact that we often ran into small technical problems and we realised that there must be a wealth of technical resource in our area. Crystal Palace is historically linked to the principles of advancing through science and technology and bringing all new innovation together in one place. Kevin, as you may expect, has a keen interest in all types of technology, and I have a passion for most things science (even the bad bits are usually fascinating). From this grew the idea of the Silicon Triangle.</description>

        <title>i-Luddite</title>
        <description>If you just keep asking questions you eventually start knowing things, which is initially disconcerting but ultimately feels good, like gradually getting into a too hot bath. Now when I type into a password box and it replaces letters with little circles, I donâ€™t assume it is witchcraft. I am slowly becoming one of them.</description>

        <title>Back to work</title>
        <description>Today is my first day back in the office after a week in Portugal with my family. Getting back into the swing of things can be a challenge but today I was really keen to get back and getting cracking on setting up our charity events in aid of Mind in Croydon.</description>

        <title>Nurse Appraisal Conference</title>
        <description>We recently attended the &#39;Nursing Appraisal and Revalidation&#39; conference in London, which was a very useful and insightful event. Having a background plunged into the inner depths of medical revalidation and as a company looking to expand our systems to fulfill future requirements, this conference could not have come at a better time. I think there was a little nervousness about readiness, both from our persepctive and from those who will have to undertake this process. However this conference managed to highlight some important anxiety busters. Firstly, although things are moving quickly, no final decisions have been made, which is useful for us as we want to make sure we are part of the process and develop solutions that meet the actual need and not the percieved one. Secondly, it was clear that it was a well thought out process and the NMC were trying to ensure that Nurse revalidation met the requirements of nurses and was not just a carbon copy of revalidation for doctors.</description>
