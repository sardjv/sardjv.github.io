				<h4>In Development - SARD announces development of Appraisal for all system</h4>
				<p> SARD are pleased to announce that it is further developing the capability of its platform to extend the system in order to cover the appraisal process for all staff. It is a logical step as we already know our revalidation and appraisal system helps thousands of doctors and we felt that our system could further support other colleagues within the NHS. Project plans have been drawn up and development is about to start. We are very excited about what we can produce and more importantly how this can help organisations to run, record and report on appraisals for all staff.</p>
						
				<h4>Sussex Community sign-up to use SARD</h4>
				<p>We are proud to announce that Sussex Community NHS Foundation Trust has just recently signed up to use the SARD Revalidation and Appraisal system. Implementation is underway and we are looking forward to this new partnership.</p>

				<h4>King's Fund Survey finds Systems and IT are key to Revalidation process - 05 November 2013</h4>
					
				<p>The King's Fund has published the results of a survey conducted amongst 53 London-based Responsible Officers. The main objective of the survey was to capture the experiences and reflections of ROs in London.</p>
        
        <p>One of the conclusions from the survey is the integral part IT systems play in a successful revalidation process.
From the report:</p>

        <p>"The Importance of systems and IT"</p>
        
        <p>Most ROs in both the survey and the qualitative interviews referred to the importance for revalidation of having established systems and processes with their organisations.</p>

        <p>Where organisations were viewed as having robust processes in place, ROs reported a positive overall experience."
