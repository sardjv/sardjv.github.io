With the ongoing uncertainty over the UK’s exit from the EU in March and the terms under which this will occur, it is understandable that some of our clients have been voicing concerns over what will happen to their suppliers in the event of a No Deal Brexit.

We would like to reassure all our trusts and organisations that the effect on SARD of our withdrawal from the EU is expected to be minimal. As Cloud Based SaaS (Software As A Service) providers, we do not rely on physical deliveries or imports/exports. Some of our data servers are physically situated outside the UK but still within the EU, and are run by large, internationally renowned companies such as Amazon and Linode, who will remain resilient and able to continue providing services with little, if any, disruption. 

Our development and support is all based in the UK and we are not reliant on any particular EU suppliers to continue to provide our services to you. 

The EU General Data Protection Regulation, which has been at the forefront of information security this year, will continue to apply in the guise of the UK-specific Data Protection Act 2018, which is already in place and which is more or less a facsimile of the GDPR. 

We will of course continue to monitor the situation as it develops - whichever way Westminster decides to go on March 29th - but at this point we don’t anticipate any particular problems with being able to continue to provide the great technology and customer service that our customers are used to. 

If you are an existing client, any impact questionnaires or enquiries regarding the EU Exit can be addressed to me at <a href="mailto:naomi@sardjv.co.uk">naomi@sardjv.co.uk</a>.
