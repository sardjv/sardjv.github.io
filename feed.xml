        <title>Real Human Relations</title>
        <description>When thinking what topic to write about for this month&#39;s blog post, I thought it’d make sense to write about my job in customer service support for SARD. I’ll write a little about that, but also focusing on the importance of human relations within the work place and also with our clients and end users.</description>

        <title>Don&#39;t bring me solutions, bring me problems.</title>
        <description>Organisations define a majority of their procurement requirements with a presupposed solution. As a result, the winning bid is not as cheap or effective as possible. They can fix this by making the problem, and not the solution, the backbone of the document.</description>

        <title>Turning off the targeting computer</title>
        <description>When Apollo 11 took the first men to the moon, NASA intended that a computer would guide the landing. The site selection team had picked a smooth patch of ground. But the guidance system was taking the Lunar Module into a field of boulders the size of a football pitch. So, in the last 500ft, Neil Armstrong turned off the ‘targeting computer’. He took manual control, landed, and the rest is history. Later Apollo landings switched off the computer at final descent.</description>
