I had some time off this month for an operation and was fortunate enough to be treated in the day surgery unit of Princess Royal University Hospital, now run by Kings College Hospital NHS FT. When my anaesthetist and her assistant asked me what I did, I don't think they were expecting to be asked if they liked their appraisal software!

Fortunately, the anaesthetist had used SARD to complete her appraisal in April and said she liked the system very much. Unfortunately, I was out for the count before I could ask her for a full testimonial!

Was hoping to get an MSF form to see it from the patient side. Maybe next time.
