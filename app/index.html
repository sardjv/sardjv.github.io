						  <h2>Philip Bottle</h2>
						  <h3>Director of Sales and Marketing</h3>	  
						  <p>Throughout my working career, both in the NHS and outside of it, it has always been a passion of mine to make things better, tobe part of something that has a positive impact. The premise is always the same, invest time in improving the things we have to do, make the small things easy to eventually make the big things easy, and working for SARD is the epitome of this.</p> 
 
<p>I have always felt that it is important to understand why we do things, asking the important questions and get to the real nub of the questions in order to produce the best answers. If my skills and knowledge, combined with those around me can help have a positive impact on the organisations we are working with then I have started to achieve my goals.</p> 
 
<p>I have worked in both the private and the public sector over the last 16 years, and prior to working with SARD JV I spent 5 years in the NHS, creating positive change and living the day to day, challenges as well as witnessing the challenges that others faced. My last role was Head of Learning and Development at Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust, a very different role to the one I am in now.</p>  

<p>As like many of my colleagues, I like to indulge in activities outside of work, and I am currently finishing off a number of writing projects, which I find both relaxing and rewarding. Who knows one day you may get to read some of my work when they are on the bestsellers list.

						  <h2>Sophie Buijsen</h2>
						  <h3>Account Manager</h3>
						  <p>Hello! 
I’m Sophie and I am one of the account managers at SARD JV.  In fact, I was the very first account manager SARD JV ever had. When I joined the company in November 2012, SARD was on the verge of growth and it was very exciting. I was there when the first big contacts came in, when it became clear that SARD JV was not just a small player in a big field, but could actually make a difference.</p>

<p>For me the way SARD JV is different than anywhere I’ve ever worked before is that our customer service is not just a meaningless slogan. No one in this company reads from scripts or waves away queries. We are all invested in our solutions and we’re all invested in making sure that our clients and end users like our systems as much as we do.</p>
 
<p>Before I came to SARD JV I completed an MSc in Science Communication, which is an interest I still hold dear. Which is why Kevin and I run a monthly science and technology meet-up in Crystal Palace, called the Silicon Triangle, where we get together with like minded people and talk about the projects we are working on. Listening to the enthusiasm of others is always inspiring and often helps us innovate our solutions as well.
Besides this I write science stories on sciphie.wordpress.com and am the sub-editor of the zine ‘You’ve Got Mail’ (http://gotmailzine.wordpress.com/)</p>

				<h2>Nicholas Cooke</h2>
				<h3>Account Manager</h3>
				<p>I am an account manager for SARD JV which gives me hands on experience with people using the system every day, whether this is improving and streamlining our system to the specific needs of a client or problem solving on our online chat feature.</p>
					
				<p>As we are a relatively small company it means that we all feel a very personal stake in the companies activities, whether that is dealing with clients, testing systems or organizing charity events.</P>
 
				<p>Because we are very open as a company it means as employees we can each tailor our work according to our own strengths and what we most enjoy.</P>
 
				<p>Having studied at both Sussex University and University of East London, I spent 6 years working in the world of Optics in various different ways. This has instilled an interest in the ways different institutions and industries can collaborate and find mutual goals.</P>
					
				<p>I feel we are in an interesting position being a joint venture with an NHS trust, we are both part of the NHS framework but have the freedom to really get to the core of problems and provide innovative and fresh solutions.</p>
					
					<p>In my time away from work I run a storytelling night in Crystal Palace, I have been involved in writing and performing for many years, including participating in the Edinburgh and Brighton Fringes Festivals.

										<h3>Lead Developer</h3>
										<p>I have been working on SARD from the very first day of development, so you could say that the system is like a child to me. I was present at the first requirement gathering exercise and I hope I bring a wealth of experience to the team having worked on two previous Mango Swiss products (also deployed within NHS Trusts).</p>

<p>I graduated with a degree in Computer Science in 1997. Since I graduated I have built up extensive knowledge and experience including working on on the C++ Java API for the Symbian Operating System for mobile phones and for the PSion range of personal organisers before joining Mango Swiss. What I love is that all of the experience of how things work well has been applied to the SARD range of systems.</p>

<p>There is nothing I love more that problem solving and a thorough attention to detail which I dare say makes me a natural born programmer and it's starting to show in the next generation as my 8 year old son Joshua has started writing his first Ruby code. Such a proud mum.</p>

			  						  <h3>Research Manager</h3>
			  						  <p>I first started working with SARD in the earliest days when Kevin asked me to come along to a meeting to input into early research and marketing plans. I loved the atmosphere and the customer service ethos of the company and started working as permanent Head of Research and Events shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>I have worked in HR and candidate research within both the public and private sectors and prior to joining SARD spent four years as a fundraising manager for the NSPCC, supporting their National Development Board, delivering gala fundraising events and working with major corporate partners. These varied experiences have helped provide a good understanding how large organisations work and the vital importance of providing clients with the best possible customer service.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I am Secretary to the Board of Trustees for Beckenham Theatre and part of the founding group for Crystal Palace Primary School, a new school that parents in the local area are hoping to open in 2015.</p>

<p>I work in the SARD office part-time and for the rest of the week I look after my lively three year old which certainly keeps me busy!
I am very proud to work for SARD and excited about our future direction.</p>

									  <h2>Naomi Liddle</h2>
									  <h3>Office Manager</h3>	  
									  <p>I’m Naomi and I’m the Office Manager at SARD JV.</p> 

<p>I’m only here a few days a week - sorting out the paperwork, making sure everyone gets paid and filing whatever needs to be filed - but I always look forward to my time catching up with the team in the SARD office. Unlike so many companies, there’s a real culture of ‘pitching in’ here, and as well as my regular tasks I know my way around the revalidation system and often jump in to help on the LiveChats. No two days are the same, and that’s part of what makes this such a dynamic and innovative company to work for.</p>

<p>I studied Drama at university before working in theatre facilities management and then spent several years running the head office of a cocktail bar chain before landing at SARD. Industries may differ, but the core values of customer service and integrity of product are what I look for in a workplace and SARD has these in abundance.</p> 

<p>Like many of the team here, I have a creative side and I exercise this in my local theatre company and in front of my trusty sewing machine.

									  <h2>Ben Travis</h2>
									  <h3>Board Director</h3>
									  <p>I am one of the Directors here at SARD, and also the Director of Finance at Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust.  From the moment we started discussing the creation of Sard JV, I have been impressed by the team who have dedicated themselves to the Sard system. Not only does it look fantastic, it's also very easy to use.</p>

<p>I've felt privileged to be involved in the setting up of this company and the journey to becoming a viable and self-sufficient business - which we now are. I put this down to a great system, a relentless focus on customer service, delivered by talented people who really care.</p>

<p>I joined the NHS in 2005, having previously worked at Arthur Andersen and Heineken; and started at Oxleas in 2011.

																<h2>Jonathan Wood</h2>
																<h3>Business Advisor</h3>
																<p>Where to start? Well I have 14 years of venture development experience, achieving converting technical excellence into a commercial success.</p>

<p>I am the founder and Director of Haven Ventures which specialises in early-stage venture development, investment management and special situations in more mature businesses, with experience in a wide range of sectors including the physical sciences, digital technologies and production industries at national and international levels. We have obtained offers of funds totalling over £100 million for early-stage companies, utilizing a wide network across private and institutional investors with deals up to £126m in mature businesses.</p>

<p>Also I have held various senior Government advisor roles in a range of areas including security technologies, telecommunications regulation, digital television, e-commerce, government contracting and deregulation, Jonathan maintains a broad network at the heart of government. I suppose the next question is why did I get involved in SARD JV. After hearing the early stage proposals, I really felt there was a positive future for the work Kevin and Oxleas where undertaking. I am glad to say that so far that intuition has born fruit and I believe it will continue to grow and have a positive impact.</p>

					<h3>Testimonials</h3>
					<p>“Following a smooth and successful implementation of SARD JV at King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, the team at SARD JV did not stop listening to us. They still pay attention to our  comments and suggestions in order to have  a system that keeps meeting our requirements. The feedback from our medical and dental staff is great. The reporting feature on SARD JV is excellent and  it  has made my job a lot easier.
Keep up the good work!”</p><h5>- Ludovic Dogbe, Job Planning & Revalidation Manager at King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust</h5>


					<p>“As the administrator of the medical appraisal and revalidation processes in an acute Trust, I was looking for an efficient and straightforward online system to support both my functions and my doctors. SARD provides this in a way which concentrates on the essentials of the processes, with a support team constantly looking to build on the already excellent system, including incorporating improvements suggested by clients. My doctors and I also really value the real time online and telephone support. I commend SARD to any organisation looking for a first class and flexible system”.</p><h5>- Andrew Forsyth, Revalidation Project Manager
Harrogate and District NHS Foundation Trust</h5>


					<p>"As an experienced appraiser using the original GMC approved documentation I had reservations about utilising the SARD software. These reservations were rapidly dispelled following the conduct of my first appraisal with the SARD documentation. It is really helpful that the web based access makes it so accessible whenever necessary and convenient. Since its adoption by my Trust the SARD team have responded positively to suggestions for improvements in its implementation. Significantly,  every single appraisee and my consultant colleagues have been very enthusiastic about using SARD. SARD has made the Revalidation process far more straightforward with its intuitive and disciplined approach".</p><h5>- Dr Tony Nicholl, Trust appraiser.  Consultant Anaesthetist Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust</h5>


					<p>“My involvement with SARD is on a daily basis, I find the system is easily understood and effortlessly taught even to the most sceptical!  I receive more and more positive feedback from the doctors now using the system and as they enter year 2 its pleasing to hear how easy they are finding the system and indeed to whole process of appraisal. I cannot praise the staff at SARDjv enough, they are always very helpful and knowledgeable.  Most importantly to me they are always very open and show willingness to develop the system and accommodate suggestions of change to the system".</p><h5>- Jane Clarke, Appraisal & Revalidation Manager Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust </h5>
					
					
			<p>“We have been managing our medical appraisal and revalidation process through SARD JV since July 2013.  The system is easy to use, can be easily adapted and we’ve had some really positive feedback from our doctors using it.  The team at SARD JV are very helpful, responsive and dedicated to providing a system fit for purpose.  I would happily recommend SARD JV to any Trust looking for an e-system to manage its appraisal and revalidation process”.</p><h5>- Angela Salmen, Senior Medical Staffing Manager Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust </h5>
			
			
		<p>I have found the SARD system robust and easy to use. The procedure for nominating colleagues for the MSF was smooth with quick responses. The patient survey took a little while longer to complete as it generally involved paper forms being sent to SARD to be uploaded. This process could take up to a week or so but I believe an email service has been set up so patient responses could be scanned in and set up. The online live support was friendly and responsive.</p><h5>- Imran Mohammad, Consultant Anaesthetist Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust</h5>
