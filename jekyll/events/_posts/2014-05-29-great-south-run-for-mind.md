On the 26th of October 2014 Kevin, Phil, Sophie and Barbara from the SARD team will be taking part in the Great South Run. The aim is to raise as much money as we possibly can for Mind in Croydon. We are obviously very excited and nervous, 10 miles is a long way, especially for a group of people that work in front of computers everyday. However with your support we know we can do it and we know we can raise money for a really good cause. If you feel that this is something that you want to support then the you can sponser online at www.justgiving.com/runningsard.
