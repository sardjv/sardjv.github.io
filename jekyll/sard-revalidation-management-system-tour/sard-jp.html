			<p>The SARD Job Planning module provides doctors with an opportunity to create their job plan in collaboration with their supervisors, and anyone else who needs access to the plan.</p> 

			<p>The plan allows for any special circumstances, and a handy calculator shows how many PAs have been contracted against the number of PAs worked.</p>
