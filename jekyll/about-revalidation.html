      <h2>About Revalidation</h2>
      <p>Revalidation is a method of regulating licensed doctors, aimed at providing further assurance to patients, that their doctors are up to date and fit to practice. Licensed doctors will have to revalidate every five years, by undertaking annual appraisals that are based on the core guidance found in the 'Good Medical Practice' presented by the GMC. All doctors that are licensed to practice need to revalidate.</p>

      <h2>When will I revalidate?</h2>
      <p>The revalidation process began in December 2012 and the GMC expects to have revalidated the majority of licensed doctors in the UK for the first time by March 2016. If you are not part of an organisation or are unsure of your designated body, you will need to communicate with the GMC to find out when it is appropriate for your revalidation to take place.</p>

      <h2>What is my designated body?</h2>
      <p>Your designated body is the organisation that will support you with your appraisal and revalidation. You only have one designated body, regardless of how many organisations you may be employed by or contract with. You can find your designated body by visiting the GMC website and looking for the 'My designated body' page'.</p>
      
      <p>Before revalidation began, the GMC contacted every licensed doctor to confirm their designated body.</p>

      <h2>What is a Responsible Officer?</h2>

      <p>A responsible officer is a designated individual, most likely the medical director of your organisation, who is tasked with making recommendations to the GMC with regards to your revalidation.</p>

      <h2>Who needs to revalidate?</h2>

      <p>Any doctor holding a licence to practice will need to be revalidated. This includes individuals who hold a licence but do not currently undertake any clinical practice, but may wish to in the future.</p>

      <h2>What is a prescribed connection?</h2>

      <p>A prescribed connection is the link to your designated body, the main organisation you work for. For the majority of Doctors this will be the organsiation that you undertake most of your clinical practice. Should your practice be spread equally then you designated body will be the organsiation closest geographically.</p>

      <p>A small minority of doctors will not have a prescribed connection to a designated body due to the nature of their practice and where they work. If this is the case then you should contact the GMC for more information.</p>

      <h2>What is multi-source feedback (MSF)?</h2>

      <p>As part of the revalidation process, all doctors will be required to request and collate feedback on how they practice from both colleagues and patients. Further guidance on this can be found on the GMC website. Further information on how the SARD system can support with the collection and analysis of MSF can be found here.</p>

      <h2>What your organisation needs for revalidation.</h2>

      <p>Your organsiation will need to have defined the roles of those involved in revalidation, from the administrators to the doctors, to the appraisers to the responsible officers. Also your organsiation will need to establish who will be responsible for the upkeep and tracking of revalidation / appraisal activity, preferably which team this task sits with. This will vary from organsiation to organisation, but as revalidation is a lengthy process it is wise to define this early.</p>

      <h2>Robust systems:</h2>

      <p>Depending on the size of your trust and the number of medics in your organisation the revalidation can potentially be labour intensive and complicated. It is therefore imperative that you have a system that supports your processes and ensures that revalidation is a simple as possible. Each doctor will require 5 years of evidence for each revalidation cycle and as such old methods of data recording such as using excel spreadsheets will not be sufficient. There are a number of systems available on the market that can meet your organsiations needs including our own.</p>
