SARD JV is a 6 year old company that has never lost a client. In the first 3 or 4 years, revalidation was a new process and many companies didn't have an existing system in place. Lately, that picture has changed. In the last 2 years, we've grown our suite of products to incorporate markets that have historically been poorly served such as job planning and more of our future clients are reaching the end of hastily agreed revalidation and appraisal contracts with our competitors.

As a result, we're regularly migrating clients from our competitors. We have built sophisticated technology to upload information from them. It's now a painless process to transfer over to SARD. If you're dissatisfied with your current provider then please speak to us and we can give testimonials and case studies of those migrations. To give just one example, Nottingham University Hospitals transferred from their legacy job planning system to SARD and saw their compliance rates rise from 28% to over 80% within the first year alone. We're expecting that to increase even further in their second year. Similar examples of successful migrations exist for medical appraisal and revalidation.
