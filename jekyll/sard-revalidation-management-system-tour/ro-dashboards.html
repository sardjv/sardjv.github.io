			<p>On completion of an appraisal form, the responsible officer can either receive the appraisal in full or the appraisal summary sections only. These are clearly marked, so that the other sections of the appraisal form remain a private discussion between the appraiser and doctor and are not disclosed to the Responsible Officer.</p>

			<p>A Responsible Officer has a 'Responsible Officer Dashboard' that provides an overview of revalidation and appraisal accross the entire organisation. It provides a way to oversee the QA status of the different components that are needed for revalidation. They are also able to drill down into finer detail to see appraisal at a directorate, or hospital level.</p>
