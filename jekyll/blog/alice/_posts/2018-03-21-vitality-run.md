I am very excited (and a bit nervous!) to announce that our first official activity towards meeting our £5000 target for Crisis will be entering the <a href="https://www.vitalitylondon10000.co.uk">Vitality London 10000.</a>

On 28th May myself, Cheyne, Kevin, Francesca and Alex (who has now left SARD but can’t keep away!) will be donning our Crisis running vests and trainers. 

If you are in London on what we hope will be a beautiful, sunny Bank Holiday please give us a wave as we pass. For anyone that would like to support us, we can be sponsored as a group via our <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/company/sardjv">Justgiving page.</a>
